<p>I desperately wanted to like this, but simply couldn't. Told from the
perspective of Stéphane, including his dreams and imagination. The
consequent home-made surrealism was amusing for the first half hour, but
felt overused and pointless by the end. As the movie went on, Stéphane's
actions could only really be explained by filling them under the general
heading of 'having trouble interfacing with reality' - any more granular
or subtle motives were unclear to me. I feel mean saying this, because
there were endearingly whimsical touches throughout, but if there was a
point, I missed it.</p>

<p>I've been riding high on the sheer joy that is Guitar Hero II (PS2) recently.
Now that <em>Psychobilly Freakout</em> is the only remaining song for which a
five-star review performance is still eluding me, before unleashing the
masochistically feverish <em>hard</em> difficulty setting at least, it's time
for me to get my ass into gear and learn to play a <em>real</em> musical
instrument.</p>
<p>Dithering
between piano / keyboard and acoustic / electric guitar, I've decided to
take a few week's lessons in each, to see which initially suits me best.
Accordingly (Speaking of which, I also find the accordion strangely
compelling), I had my first ever piano lesson this weekend.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mariostakoushis.com/html/about.php" title="Mr Marios Takoushis"><img alt="Mr Marios Takoushis" src="files/2007/05/marious.jpg"></a></p>
<p>My tutor,
<a href="http://www.mariostakoushis.com/html/about.php">Marios</a>, an amiable
Greek professional musician with appropriately mad hair, seems like a
brilliant choice thus far: I'm sure we'll get along famously, with only
the minimum amount of absolutely necessary knuckle-rapping.</p>
<p><strong>Update 14:35:</strong> Just remembered: One of the first puzzling things I
discovered is that notes on the bass clef stave are offset from the
notes on the treble clef stave by a non-integer number of octaves.
Hence, a note which would represent 'C' on a treble clef stave is
actually an 'E' when drawn on a bass clef stave. Presumably there's a
reason for this, but I've yet to hear an explanation that sounds like
anything other than a wart on the notation. Can any of my multitudinous
readers enlighten me?</p>

<p><em>Director: Danny Boyle.</em>
<em>Writer: Alex Garland.</em>
<em>Starring: Cillian Murphy, Rose Byrne, Cliff Curtis, Chris Evans, Michelle Yeoh.</em>
2007.</p>

<em>Dark days are coming.</em></p>
<p>I saw this weeks ago but never got around to a write-up, from which you
might guess it was a little disappointing. Which is a tragedy, because
the <em>reason</em> it was disappointing is that it has so much potential. It
strives to do the right thing, exploring the psychological extremes felt
by a crew of eight on a year-long mission to the Sun, the fate of the
world on their shoulders. Aspiring to emulate Kubrick, both thematically
and visually, it alludes to humankind's search for God, the character of
Searle being driven over weeks to increase his exposure to the
unfiltered ravages of the sun, until, when other characters are fried to
a crisp outside the ship, he grabs the comm, frantically asking "Kaneda,
what do you see? <em>What do you see?</em>"</p>
<p>But the allusions are too tenuous, too infrequent, and never followed up
on. The inspirations drawn from
<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0062622/"><em>2001</em></a> and from 2002's
<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0307479/"><em>Solaris</em></a> shine brightly, but
Sunshine doesn't come close to emerging from their shadow.</p>
<p>When things are brought to a head in the final third of the movie, it
all descends into plain old slasher flick territory, utterly wasting the
careful set-up of the earlier scenes. There's an interesting use of
cinematographic blur and flicker, which retain the tension by never
clearly showing what the remaining crew are up against, and also to my
reading, serving as a palpable visible expression of the furious,
searing madness that exudes from an individual who has spent far too
much time in the sun.</p>
<p>Once all that is done, the final, final scene contains some redemption.
But it's too little too late. I don't remember the last time I saw so
many beautiful scenes, so terribly wasted.</p>
<p>Rating 5/10.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I wish I could have put it as eloquently as <a href="http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2007/07/chemical-radiance-review-of-film.html">this guy

<p>Rohan and I finally understood the movie <a href="posts/religion-at-last/the-fountain">The
Fountain</a> last night. I say finally - Rohan
has only ever seen the first and last 15 minutes (oh, how apt!) It's
fair to say it blew our minds.</p>
<p>SPOILERS. Big time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>foun-tain <em>noun</em>.</p>
<ol>
<li>A spring or source of water; the source or head of a stream.</li>
<li>The source or origin of anything. The beginning. <em>Genesis</em>.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>She finally taught him that they get reborn. That's why she wasn't
afraid of dying any more. That's why the two of them meet over and over
through history. That's why he is so tearfully happy to realise he is
about to die. Because death is their road to immortality. To be reborn.
To live forever.</p>
<p>This is how the tree of life grants immortality - by allowing them to
realise this. Nothing has changed, other than their own knowledge.</p>
<p>The conclusion of his journey, to reach the nebula with the tree, is
just in time for the end of the universe, which then immediately leaps
back into being again, a new Creation, in the fires of which, the First
Father is sacrificed on the tree of life, which blossoms anew. The
circle is completed. The ring, which was lost, is now found.</p>
<p>She tries to tell him, to help him fulfil his destiny, but he has to
figure it out for himself, at the proper time. He has to die in the
heart of the nebula, that his ashes might seed the tree of life into
blossoming anew in the fires of a new creation.</p>
<p>| "What do you think about that?" She asks him.
| "About what?"
| "About death as a creative act."</p>
<p>Izzy and Tom will be reborn in this new universe, too, many times down
the centuries of history. They will live an infinite number of lives
together. Forever. So long as he finds his way to the end of all things,
to renew the cycle.</p>
<p>| "Finish it." She told him.
| "I'm trying. I don't know how." He replies.
| "You do. You will."</p>
<p>He is Adam, who sustained his unnaturally extended life to the year 2500
by subsisting on of the tree of life. She is his Eve, who partook of the
tree of knowledge at the beginning. The trees are literally the self
same plant.</p>
<p>This is why the same scenes happen over and over. Until, in one of the
interminable infinity of cascading universes, something different
happens. Tommy changes his mind. It's a bona fide miracle. He exercises
his free will, does something differently this time around - He bails
out of work, to go walk with Izzy in the first snow. He has learned that
he can't save her. That he cannot, must not try to save her. For only in
death do they find rebirth, and the immortality she has promised him.</p>
<p>The rational, male left-brained mind can only comprehend so much. It is
limited to knowledge within the domain of individual lives' observable
horizons. Each of these lives is punctuated by death, which is to lose
all knowledge, all memories. Delineated by such singularities, the
rational mind can never encompass the whole picture. To understand more,
one needs to go beyond what can be known. One must believe in the things
beyond the singularity, things that can never be known. You must have
faith.</p>
<p>I am religious, and there is no God.</p>
<p><strong>Update 30/04/2007:</strong> I suppose that the climactic event at the nebula
doesn't have to represent the end / creation of whole universes. It
could merely (!) represent the star at the core of the nebula collapsing
beyond the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrasekhar_limit">Chandrasekhar
limit</a>, and undergoing
spontaneous nova as a result. The corresponding storyline interpretation
being that, rather than spawning new iterations of whole universes, Adam
is instead seeding life in the formation of new solar systems, and so
spreading life across the galaxy. <em>My Conquistador</em>, she calls him.</p>
<p><strong>Update 05/05/2007:</strong> added the dictionary definition at the head of
the page, judiciously snipped from
<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fountain">dictionary.com</a> and
from the corresponding entry on
<a href="http://thesaurus.reference.com/browse/fountain">thesaurus.com</a>, and
couldn't resist various wording improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2018:</strong> The director has stated unambiguously that the above
is all wrong.</p>

<p><em>Director: Alfonso Cuarón.
Writer: Alfonso Cuarón, et al.
Starring: Clive Owen, Michael Caine, Julianne Moore.
2006.
Based on a novel by P.D. James.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0206634/"><img alt="Internet Movie Database" src="files/2007/03/imdb.png"></a>
<em>No children. No future. No hope.</em></p>
<p><img alt="" src="files/2007/04/children-of-men2.jpg">]</p>
<p>A dystopian near-future Britain depicted with a realism that is both
heartbreaking and horrifying, and directed with a relentless yet
unobtrusive kinematic intensity. The human race has been infertile for
the last eighteen years. Society has lost all hope for the future, and
is tearing itself apart. The island of Great Britain presents a last,
desperate bastion of civilisation, turning fascist in a failing effort
to retain control. Militarised police line London's grimy streets, while
animated Orwellian public information displays warn that it is a
criminal offence to aid the flood of illegal refugees arriving from
mainland Europe.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="files/2007/04/children-of-men3.jpg">]</p>
<p>The cast are incredible all round, particularly Clive Owen's tired and
reluctant hero, a powerfully understated performance that captivates for
every second of the movie. Michael Caine's aging hippy, which he based
on John Lennon, is an absolute scene-stealing delight.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="files/2007/04/children-of-men4.jpg"></p>
<p>But it's the cinematography that is the real star, gripping and compelling
throughout, every scene lent a terrible beauty. Several minutes-long
handheld camera shots demonstrate fearsome logistical preparations
behind the camera, providing some battle scenes that are as intense,
immersive and terrifying as those from Saving Private Ryan, without
needing the gore.</p>
<p>Rating: 9/10.
A stunning film, compelling and emotionally harrowing, only falling
short of a magic '10' by virtue of lacking a real life-changing message.</p>

<p>My exposure to test-driven software development at Resolver Systems has
resulted in a tremendous enthusiasm for the idea. Doubtless a
significant proportion of my zeal stems from my own over-compensation
for arriving late to this particular party, but nevertheless, I truly
believe that it's the most significant evolution the craft of software
engineering has had in decades. For thirty years we've had good reason
to believe Brooks' assertion that there will be no silver bullet, and
now I can't shake the feeling that this is the closest thing to it that
we'll ever have any right to expect.</p>
<p>After hearing suggestions from
<a href="http://andrzejonsoftware.blogspot.com">Andrzej</a> on improving our use of
mock objects in our unit tests, I did a little reading around the ideas
he mentioned. One of the best essays I found was Martin Fowler's piece,
entitled <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">mock objects aren't
stubs.</a></p>
<p><img alt="Mock classes used in unit tests as stubs." src="files/2007/04/mocks-arent-stubs.png"><em>Class UnderTest, shown on the left in use by release software, and on the
right in a test environment, using stubbed out mock helper classes.</em></p>
<p>Clearly, the idea of a generic mock object class isn't a brand-new one,
and Martin's essay describes several such utilities that have been
around for various lengths of time, but it is something I hadn't really
thought about until this week. We do use mock objects in our tests at
Resolver, in the sense of stub classes. When our class-under-test calls
methods on other 'adjacent' classes, then the test will first substitute
some mock object, often defined on the spot, to replace the adjacent
class. This decoupling of the class-under-test from other adjacent
classes keeps the tests simple and orthogonal.</p>
<p>If these mock objects had no methods on them, then the class under test
would barf when it tried to call methods on the mock. So we add empty
stub methods on the mock, to mimic the method names present on the
adjacent class it replaces.</p>
<p>This conventional kind of test works well. State changes within the
object-under-test can easily be asserted. Also, state changes to other,
mocked objects cannot be directly tested, since the simple stub mocks
described above maintain no internal state. In a way, this is fortunate,
since such state changes to adjacent objects should not be tested, or at
least not by the test under discussion. Those state changes should be
implemented by method calls on the adjacent objects, and tested in the
adjacent object's own unit test instead.</p>
<p>However, this only emphasises how important it is that, as well as our
own state changes, we should also be testing the behaviour of our
object-under-test by asserting that it makes the correct method calls to
adjacent objects. Not all method calls should be tested though - they
can be split into two categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Method calls made to calculate state changes in the current
    object-under-test.</li>
<li>Method calls made to inform other objects that they need to update
    their own internal state.</li>
</ol>
<p>Method calls belonging to the second category need to be explicitly
tested for. At Resolver we often implement such tests using a 'Listener'
test pattern, which can be used to assert that a given method on an
adjacent object was called with the correct arguments. Martin's essay
describes a generic mock object class that can be instructed to assert
that particular methods on it were called with particular parameters,
and this seems like a convenient pattern, particularly the methods which
create appropriately named stub methods on the mock object based upon a
given class. We could, I think, use this idea at Resolver in places, if
only to cut down on the manual creation of stubbed-out mock classes
throughout our test code.</p>
<p>However, the method of testing-by-behaviour that Martin describes does
not seem to always be applicable. The first of the two categories of
method calls above can and should be tested for by looking soley at the
resultant state changes in the object-under-test. It is these state
changes which are important, not the methods used to effect them.
Asserting that various helper classes were used to make an internal
state change only makes the test needlessly brittle to alternative
implementations that achieve the same result.</p>

<p>PC, Mod of Half-Life 2</p>
<p>So the digital ink is barely dry on my assertions that videogames have
problems telling a story, when what should fall into my lap but one of
those rare and immaculate counter-examples to shut me right up.
<a href="http://www.hylobatidae.org/minerva/">Minerva: Metastatis</a> is a
bedroom-coded Half-Life 2 (HL2) mod that develops a storyline set within
the HL2 universe, a new thread in the tale of the alien Combine's
invasion of Earth. It has been three years in the making, and it's
<em>bloody brilliant</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="files/2007/04/metastasis_10004.jpg"></p>
<p>The baseline HL2 gameplay is not changed one iota. Metastasis eschews
the normal stock-in-trade of the mod scene, introducing no new enemies,
no new weapons, no new assets such as bitmaps or sound effects. Instead,
it envelops the player in an enthralling atmospheric experience, with a
compelling backstory and superb player motivation, using a sublime
combination of architecture, geometric composition, intensely creative
injected textual fragments and well-considered use of music. This is
backed up by the superbly crafted accompanying
<a href="http://www.hylobatidae.org/minerva/">website</a>, that does its best to
misinform and manipulate, drawing upon the best of various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game">alternate
reality game</a>
influences.</p>
<p><img alt="Shoreline" src="files/2007/04/metastasis_10012.jpg"></p>
<p>The game opens with your character dumped unceremoniously out of a
helicopter by forces unknown, onto a beach under hostile fire. Running
for cover is the only option. Once out of immediate danger, your plight
is revealed in stages by a series of messages squirted onto your
protective suit's HUD by some agency identifying themselves as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva">Minerva</a>, as in the Roman Goddess
of crafts and wisdom, a.k.a, as
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Snow-Crash-Bantam-Spectra-Book/dp/0553380958">Stephenson</a>
would have it, the Goddess of technology. Minerva's communications are
enigmatic and aloof. You are being used as her sentient reconnaissance
tool, your experiences relayed back to her remote location, that she
might investigate a small island, and its role in the Combine's
occupation.</p>
<p><img alt="Down the rabbit hole" src="files/2007/04/metastasis_20021.jpg"></p>
<p>The island plays host to the usual menagerie of HL2 critters, and
visible at its centre is a mysterious plasma discharge, which Minerva
prompts you to investigate. Clambering down, underground, you discover
the crumbling remains of old WWII fortifications, now housing the
twisted, unearthly technology of the Combine's invading forces. From
there on, things only get stranger and larger by degrees, until the
moment when even Minerva's cool begins to break, and you are left
feeling very much like an ant in a nuclear power station, with little
option but to continue exploring until the exterminators show up.</p>
<p>It's short and sweet - I played through the first and second parts in a
single night. But it's managed with such finesse, extending the
backstory of HL2 in bold new directions, building upon what was
indubitably the greatest PC game of 2005, possibly of all time, with
such verve and imagination that I have to agree with a Metastasis forum
posting: It might just be (<em>whisper it</em>) better than the source.</p>
<p>Rating: 10/10.
Bring on the third and final instalment, due later this month...</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Last week was full of great artistic experiences, but none so sublime as
these two masterpieces, which I was lucky enough to witness and
complete, respectively, in the last few days. For reasons that I'm sure
need no explanation, I've opted to review them side-by-side in a single
post.</p>
<p><strong>History</strong></p>
<p><img alt="" src="files/2007/03/nes_super_mario_bros.png"><em>: Pushkin's original novel, seen here in the English translation.</em></p>
<p>The story of Onegin derives from a Russian novel-in-verse, <em>Eugene
Onegin</em> written by Aleksandr Pushkin over the period from 1823 to 1837.
It was considered a classic of Russian literature, well-loved enough to
be quoted from memory by most Russians. Forty years later, Tchaikovsky
and Konstantin Shilovsky created the music and libretto respectively for
an operatic version of the same tale. This opera was then choreographed
as a ballet by Cranko in 1965, and it is Stolze's 2007 arrangement of
this that is now playing at the Royal Opera House in London's Covent
Garden.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="files/2007/03/eugeneonegin-book.jpg"><em>: Super Mario Bros. on the NES</em></p>
<p>New Super Mario Bros, similarly, represents the culmination of a
venerated franchise. The character of Mario first appeared as a nameless
16x16 pixel carpenter in the vintage arcade hit <em>Donkey Kong</em> (1981),
and was then retooled as a plumber and christened for <em>Mario Bros.</em>
(1983). The core gameplay mechanics of the Mushroom Kingdom were not
formulated until <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> (1985), but have formed backbone to
the series ever since. Mario has adapted nimbly to several new
generations of home consoles and handhelds, but the most significant
technical evolution came with <em>Super Mario 64</em> (1996), which made a
superlative triumph out of the difficult transition to 3D, one that
continues to stymie many of his
<a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/12/13/what-funk-is-sega-in/">contemporaries</a>
even to this day. Meanwhile, Mario continues to form the iconic mainstay
character in what is generally recognised as the most successful, and
certainly the most influential, videogame series of all time.</p>
<p><strong>Form</strong></p>
<p><img alt="" src="files/2007/03/jump.jpg"><em>: Flawlessly timed triple jumps result in extra height.</em></p>
<p>Like so many other DS outings, New Super Mario Bros. is very much a
return to form for the champion platformer. It makes solid, competent
use of the DS's dual screens and touch-sensitive technology, and brings
together the highlights of its distinguished lineage: peerless standards
of level design; an endearing levity; crisp, unambiguous graphics; a
roster of nostalgically well-known characters with their various
abilities and affiliations, and of course the pixel-perfect precision of
control that is the very embodiment of Mario. On top of the traditional
2D Mario mechanics, Nintendo have applied their usual expertise,
seamlessly incorporating moves from <em>Super Mario 64</em> et al, enriching
and polishing the control scheme, while never complicating it.
Wall-jumps, a ground-pound, and a triple-jump, complete with a couple of
cheerily superficial somersaults. Never has a controller been so
unintimidatingly overloaded with kinetic potential - latent at at first,
but blossoming by the third act, when Tatiana, now grown into a charming
and sophisticated woman, introduces her husband, Prince Gremin.</p>
<p><strong>Narrative</strong></p>
<p>Both works have in common the attempt to convey a narrative without the
aid of verbiage, with significant difficulties encountered in each case.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="files/2007/03/1703471_onegin_150a.jpg"><em>: Dumb, as in mime.</em></p>
<p>Ballet suffers from an inexpressiveness in this regard, insomuch as the
tools at the dancer's disposal are not capable of depicting much in the
way of nuanced or fine-grained detail outside of particular,
well-trodden areas. Characters may meet, part, or die, and express all
manner of elation or sorrow as they go about it, but there are only a
limited number of stories that can be told from such components. It is
difficult to imagine, say, a political thriller, or even something as
familiar and staid as a murder mystery being told without resorting to
<em>Spandau</em> ballet. Because of this, the medium as a whole seems to have
become something of a creative cul-de-sac, preoccupied with retelling
the same formulaic stories over and over again - and even these are
considered to be in need of supplementing with a written synopsis in the
program.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="files/2007/03/newsupermario.jpg"><em>: Disrupting the narrative direction.</em></p>
<p>Similarly, videogames revolve around the participation of the player,
who thus has the means to disrupt any narrative direction or pacing
anticipated by the game designer. Whatever story can be told, must
perforce be introduced either by the forced insertion of jarringly
ungamelike exposition, during which the player is frustratingly robbed
of any real input, or else must be told using the limited demonstrative
repertoire of in-game action. New Super Mario Bros. sidesteps these
difficulties by eschewing all but the most perfunctory storyline, aside
from a grown-up nod to the sordid realities behind Bowser's recurrent
princess kidnapping, hinted at by Bowser Jr. labouring under the
impression than Princess Peach may be his mother.</p>
<p><strong>Overall Impressions</strong></p>
<p>Despite their weaknesses, each of these works represents a good, solid
entry in representing the best that the mainstream of their respective
fields have to offer. Two marvellous, vigorous and thoroughly enjoyable
outings.</p>
<p><strong>Onegin</strong>
Rating 8/10.
An education.</p>
<p><strong>New Super Mario Bros.</strong>
Rating: 9/10.
A triumph.</p>

<p>Hello everybody - I think you are all lovely. Would you like to come for
tea? Great. See you tonight. I have some gorgeous videos of dog-on-dog
hot action, we could watch them together whilst wearing fluffy jumpers.
I have the worlds finest collection of stripy fluffy jumpers. They are
as hot-as-a-hot-pink-thing-would-be-if-it-was really-hot-and-pink.</p>
<p>Hmmm... all this talk of hot and pink things reminds me of a dream I had
last night. Don't you love talking about dreams. The only corollary is
how much I loathe listening to other people talk about their dreams.
Anyhoo, back to the subject. Anyhoo is an odd word. I'm sure I was
watching some obscure TV pre-processed-almost-pre-digested program of
yester-year the other day when I heard people using it. What
degradations we force upon our faithful mistress the English language.
(And the subject of degradation neatly reminds me of the dream which I
am now too distracted to talk about.)</p>
<p>Language is a great thing. That of course is obvious, but mere hyperbole
and superlatives are insufficient to express the magnitude of the
underlying awesomeness. That of course is midly ironic, which is utterly
lost on me, but there we go. Written language is almost more stupefying.
Scratchings and scribblings that convey meaning, which propels unbidden
into the mind upon the merest glance, and transcends mundane experience
to transport the imagination. How did this state of affairs ever come
into being ?</p>
<p>To explore this extraordinary situation we need to devolve, literally of
course - but also literarily, to component components. Tangentially I
would say this is a bad idea, but parenthetically I would *love* to
watch you try.</p>
<p>Anyway (is this a sentence?). To those of you who have endured to the
ends, I am deeply sorry.</p>

<p><em>by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner (2005)</em></p>
<p>It was a bit of a phenomenon when it first came out, and I'm well known
for my curmudgeonly resistance to popular phenomena, so forgive me for
being so late to the party. I reached a point, sitting on a train
carriage surrounded by no less than <em>twenty-six</em> commuters all
obliviously reading the same book, where my resistance snapped and I
simply had to buy a copy and join them.</p>
<p>Bit of a let-down, though. Not so much the wisdom of crowds, more like
the lowest common denominator. There are cool ideas, here and there,
which had me chuckling with glee, but these are few and far between,
padded out monstrously, repeated almost verbatim in the introduction and
then in the main text and then a third time in the 'bonus' sections
tacked on to this revised edition. By the end I was sick of hearing
about them. Roll it all up in the sort of rhetoric that feels the need
to patiently explain that 'correlation is not causation!', and then
illustrate it with pages of examples, and you'll see why I quickly lost
patience.</p>
<p>Rating: 4/10. Rogue economist, indeed.</p>
