<p>Spent last weekend in lovely Copenhagen, courtesy of our
native guide, Susan's friend Rasmus. The ever genial Witt Mathot, and
his sidekick Mike, were also in town giving some GIS Server training
course. Consequently I spent Monday sickasadog. Quite possibly I will
never be the same again. Regardless, the city was terrific and its
inhabitants warm, genuine and kind, even after an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/6715785.stm">outrageous
travesty</a>
inflicted by Sweden on the football pitch. Hurrah for bastions of
civilisation, even though their politicians are, by all accounts, going
down the pan just as fast as ours are. Through the whole weekend, I only
said 'Dutch' when I meant 'Danish' once, which by my standards makes me
a beacon of informed, considerate enlightenment. Defining memory:
Pleasant post-party walks home through the city in the dawn sunlight,
amongst streams of happy, chatting, cycling people all doing the same.</p>

    <p>The lovely Susan and I managed to nip into the
<a href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/exhibitions/gameon/">Game On</a>
exhibit at the
<a href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/">Science Museum</a>,
back in February,
just before it ended. I was so glad that we did - what a delight it was!
I couldn't believe the assemblage of classic hardware they had packed
into those rooms, all working and playable.</p>
<p>I wanted to write a lovingly detailed description of all the games we
found therein, wallowing in nostalgia and techno-fetishism. But in the 3
months since I first wrote the above paragraph, I've never got around to
completing it, so the following annotated list of my personal highlights
from the first section will have to suffice for the moment, though it is
naught but a gnarled stub of the monument I had envisaged.</p>
<h5>Spacewar! (MIT, 1962)</h5>
<p><img alt="Spacewar! on the PDP-1's oscilloscope-like display." src="files/2007/05/sw.jpg"><em>Spacewar! on the PDP-1's oscilloscope-like display.</em></p>
<p>Not just the strongest entry for the hotly-contested title of 'first
ever computer game', but actually by far and away the most <em>fun</em> of any
of the contenders, featuring a depth of gameplay that wouldn't be
matched until <em>Defender</em>, nearly 20 years later. A two player deep-space
duel with Newtonian physics, which remains surprisingly playable even
today. About 200 hours of work went into writing the initial version,
which was then refined with touches such as a background starfield which
maps every star from the real night sky of fifth magnitude or brighter,
precessing slowly to display all the well-known constellations as the
game progresses. The Game-On exhibit had the original hardware on show,
a defunct PDP-1 the size of a Hummer, which ran at 0.2MHz. In an
inadvertent demonstration of Moore's Law, a playable simulacrum of the
game itself was provided on a six-inch Vectrex from the '80s.</p>
<h5>Pong (Atari, 1972)</h5>
<p><img alt="Pong (1972)" src="files/2007/05/pong-01.png"></p>
<p>Nolan Bushnell founds Atari, and when the local bar reports his first machine
to be 'broken', it turns out to be due to its innards overflowing with
quarters. Before my time, this one, but a clear indicator of things to
come. Interestingly, many of the subsequent incarnations of Pong, for
home consoles and the like, didn't play as well as this original model,
since it was constructed using dedicated analog electronics, which
enabled a rapid framerate, and commensurate fluidity of gameplay, which
could not be matched by software implementations for years to come.</p>
<h5>Space Invaders (Taito, 1978)</h5>
<p><img alt="Space Invaders" src="files/2007/05/wspace_invaders.png"></p>
<p>Triggered coin shortages in Japan, prompting the government to quadruple the
supply of 1 Yen coins. To this day the cultural resonance lives on, as
the French urban street artist 'Invader' is still placing his discreet
mosaics in public places around the world, returning only when local
authorities scrape them off, to put a small white number where the
invader used to be. I was never quite as massively captivated by it as
by other games, although no doubt my parents would protest that was only
because 10p coins were in such short supply for my seven-year old self.
I however, shall stick to my story, that perhaps the blatantly
predictable gameplay proved fractionally less of a lure than other,
subsequent titles that left a little more to the imagination.</p>
<h5>Asteroids (Atari, 1979)</h5>
<p><img alt="Asteroids" src="files/2007/05/asteroids.png"></p>
<p>A clear descendant of the original <em>Spacewar</em>, featuring deep-space based
Newtonian combat rendered with rotational vector graphics which afford
an austere Kubrickian elegance to the presentation. In common with many
games of this vintage, the terrific bass thumps and distinctive chirps
and warbles of the sound effects were produced using custom analog
electronics, specifically designed for the game. The combination is
dynamite, and Asteroids went on to become Atari's greatest selling game
of all time, tempting ten year olds such as myself into countless hours
spent lurking around the screen edges, dreaming of a high-stakes
lifestyle out beyond the Kuiper belt in a singleship, hunting down those
high-scoring UFOs.</p>
<h5>Pac Man (Namco, 1979)</h5>
<p><img alt="Pac-Man" src="files/2007/05/pac.gif"></p>
<p>"If computer games affected our behaviour, then by now there'd be a
generation that had grown up running around in darkened rooms, munching
magic pills and listening to repetitive electronic music - oh, hang on."</p>
<h5>Missile Command (Atari, 1980)</h5>
<p><img alt="Missile Command" src="files/2007/05/missile_a.png"></p>
<p>The game's original design tasked the player with the defence of American
west coast cities, from San Diego to San Francisco, while unending waves
of nukes rained down like fireflies. Cold war tensions made that
scenario a little too chilling for comfort, so the game was re-cast with
a science-fiction setting. The result, with immaculate use of a
then-novel trackball controller, and seismic sound effects, constituted
a classic that remained a prominent and profitable entry in arcades for
fifteen years after its release, and remains an inspiration for modern
games such as Defcon (PC, 2006).</p>
<h5>Battlezone (Atari, 1980)</h5>
<p><img alt="Battlezone" src="files/2007/05/800px-arcade-atari-battlezone1.png"></p>
<p>A trailblazing first-person perspective 3D virtual reality, and famously
adapted by the US Army to train gunnery crews of the Bradley Fighting
Vehicle. Myths surrounding the game abounded, of increasingly esoteric
enemies that could be encountered with prolonged play, of continued
progress towards the distant mountains leading to the exploration of
exotic terrain, and the discovery of factories which were producing the
endless supply of enemy tanks rolling your way. In reality, the hardware
was hard-pressed to perform the required 3D calculations for even the
simple surroundings presented at the start of the game, and there was no
more content than could be seen within five minutes of that. And yet,
the stark scenarios it presented blossomed within the imagination of my
young self, offering possibilities for the presentation of limitless
worlds, to anyone who could bring with them but a modicum of
willing-suspension.</p>
<h5>Defender (Williams, 1980)</h5>
<p><img alt="Get away from me!" src="files/2007/05/defender1.gif" title="Get away from me!"></p>
<p>While its contemporaries could often be mastered by careful, methodical
play, memorising patterns, and the occasional bout of dexterity,
<em>Defender</em> proved to be the ultimate test of reactions, spatial
awareness and hand-eye skill. Once underway, the game becomes a non-stop
roller-coaster of pant-wettingly tense action, as your gymnastically
maneuverable craft, spitting pyrotechnic plutonium death, carefully
rescues fragile humanoids from a sky full of of the most fiendish,
purposeful, body-snatching, god-damned alien sons-of-bitches to ever be
rendered in pixel. Clearly the hatred in me lives on.</p>
<h5>End of the Early Arcade Scene</h5>
<p>For me, Defender marks a watershed in the industry, prior to which games
developers had to go through extraordinary contortions in order to coax
the primitive hardware of the times into producing anything coherent on
the screen at all. As a result, the games of the era were forced to
model simple worlds, depicted using visuals that were highly stylised,
to say the least. To this day I find a kind of beauty in the abstract
minimalism that this required, a kind that, with occasional exceptions,
is missing from games of later generations.</p>
<p>The game developers of the day were more inventors than engineers or
authors. Their creativity was necessarily of a predominantly
left-brained kind, but as is so often the case, in being channeled by
the technical restrictions they faced, that creativity responded by
seeking out nooks and crannies in which to flourish, and then leaping
forth, blossoming in unexpected directions, producing games with rude,
brash exteriors, but nonetheless exuding a rugged and determined charm,
lurching with barely contained excitement from one harebrained idea to
the next.</p>
<p>Defender in many ways marks the culmination of this era. Primary author
Eugene Jarvis' legendary programming efforts wrung incredible results
from the paltry hardware resources at his disposal, while introducing
concepts such as the horizontally-scrolling wraparound landscape, the
tactical awareness granted by the radar, the smart bomb - which
perfectly offset the otherwise ruthlessly difficult play. All of these
would remain staples in the industry for decades to come. Each one,
arguably, an inevitable invention, an idea who's time had come, an mere
incremental development of the exploration of virtual space that nascent
gaming represented. But nonetheless, each one, inarguably, had never
been done before. To bring them all together in a single sustained
creative outburst represented a peak, a marriage of engineering, art,
business and frivolity that had never previously been attempted.</p>
<p>By 1981, just one year after the release of Defender, the hardware
quickly standardised and evolved such that it no longer created such
intrusive restrictions on creativity. The business model had been well
established, the market assuredly huge and growing every year. The risks
and the difficulties overcome, a mass of new game companies moved in,
flooding the market with uninspired, profit-driven efforts and mediocre
imitations. Programmers were relegated to programming, artists and
modellers took over the visuals, and what should have been the central
role, that of game design, fell in the cracks, while the other former
partner in the creative enterprise, the players who had previously
supplied the imagination, were made redundant.</p>
<p>It wasn't all doom and gloom, however (no pun intended.) In the midst of
the impending '80s game boom, there were plenty of gems, once one
filtered through all the dross. I've found this write-up most enjoyable,
so maybe I'll write some more about that next week...</p>

    <p>The old tartley.com used to have one of these, so here's a quickie

<p>I desperately wanted to like this, but simply couldn't. Told from the
perspective of Stéphane, including his dreams and imagination. The
consequent home-made surrealism was amusing for the first half hour, but
felt overused and pointless by the end. As the movie went on, Stéphane's
actions could only really be explained by filling them under the general
heading of 'having trouble interfacing with reality' - any more granular
or subtle motives were unclear to me. I feel mean saying this, because
there were endearingly whimsical touches throughout, but if there was a
point, I missed it.</p>

<p>I've been riding high on the sheer joy that is Guitar Hero II (PS2) recently.
Now that <em>Psychobilly Freakout</em> is the only remaining song for which a
five-star review performance is still eluding me, before unleashing the
masochistically feverish <em>hard</em> difficulty setting at least, it's time
for me to get my ass into gear and learn to play a <em>real</em> musical
instrument.</p>
<p>Dithering
between piano / keyboard and acoustic / electric guitar, I've decided to
take a few week's lessons in each, to see which initially suits me best.
Accordingly (Speaking of which, I also find the accordion strangely
compelling), I had my first ever piano lesson this weekend.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mariostakoushis.com/html/about.php" title="Mr Marios Takoushis"><img alt="Mr Marios Takoushis" src="files/2007/05/marious.jpg"></a></p>
<p>My tutor,
<a href="http://www.mariostakoushis.com/html/about.php">Marios</a>, an amiable
Greek professional musician with appropriately mad hair, seems like a
brilliant choice thus far: I'm sure we'll get along famously, with only
the minimum amount of absolutely necessary knuckle-rapping.</p>
<p><strong>Update 14:35:</strong> Just remembered: One of the first puzzling things I
discovered is that notes on the bass clef stave are offset from the
notes on the treble clef stave by a non-integer number of octaves.
Hence, a note which would represent 'C' on a treble clef stave is
actually an 'E' when drawn on a bass clef stave. Presumably there's a
reason for this, but I've yet to hear an explanation that sounds like
anything other than a wart on the notation. Can any of my multitudinous
readers enlighten me?</p>

<em>Dark days are coming.</em></p>
<p>I saw this weeks ago but never got around to a write-up, from which you
might guess it was a little disappointing. Which is a tragedy, because
the <em>reason</em> it was disappointing is that it has so much potential. It
strives to do the right thing, exploring the psychological extremes felt
by a crew of eight on a year-long mission to the Sun, the fate of the
world on their shoulders. Aspiring to emulate Kubrick, both thematically
and visually, it alludes to humankind's search for God, the character of
Searle being driven over weeks to increase his exposure to the
unfiltered ravages of the sun, until, when other characters are fried to
a crisp outside the ship, he grabs the comm, frantically asking "Kaneda,
what do you see? <em>What do you see?</em>"</p>
<p>But the allusions are too tenuous, too infrequent, and never followed up
on. The inspirations drawn from
<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0062622/"><em>2001</em></a> and from 2002's
<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0307479/"><em>Solaris</em></a> shine brightly, but
Sunshine doesn't come close to emerging from their shadow.</p>
<p>When things are brought to a head in the final third of the movie, it
all descends into plain old slasher flick territory, utterly wasting the
careful set-up of the earlier scenes. There's an interesting use of
cinematographic blur and flicker, which retain the tension by never
clearly showing what the remaining crew are up against, and also to my
reading, serving as a palpable visible expression of the furious,
searing madness that exudes from an individual who has spent far too
much time in the sun.</p>
<p>Once all that is done, the final, final scene contains some redemption.
But it's too little too late. I don't remember the last time I saw so
many beautiful scenes, so terribly wasted.</p>
<p>Rating 5/10.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I wish I could have put it as eloquently as <a href="http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2007/07/chemical-radiance-review-of-film.html">this guy
did</a>.</p>

<p><em>Director: Alfonso Cuarón.
Writer: Alfonso Cuarón, et al.
Starring: Clive Owen, Michael Caine, Julianne Moore.
2006.
Based on a novel by P.D. James.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0206634/"><img alt="Internet Movie Database" src="files/2007/03/imdb.png"></a>
<em>No children. No future. No hope.</em></p>
<p><img alt="" src="files/2007/04/children-of-men2.jpg">]</p>
<p>A dystopian near-future Britain depicted with a realism that is both
heartbreaking and horrifying, and directed with a relentless yet
unobtrusive kinematic intensity. The human race has been infertile for
the last eighteen years. Society has lost all hope for the future, and
is tearing itself apart. The island of Great Britain presents a last,
desperate bastion of civilisation, turning fascist in a failing effort
to retain control. Militarised police line London's grimy streets, while
animated Orwellian public information displays warn that it is a
criminal offence to aid the flood of illegal refugees arriving from
mainland Europe.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="files/2007/04/children-of-men3.jpg">]</p>
<p>The cast are incredible all round, particularly Clive Owen's tired and
reluctant hero, a powerfully understated performance that captivates for
every second of the movie. Michael Caine's aging hippy, which he based
on John Lennon, is an absolute scene-stealing delight.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="files/2007/04/children-of-men4.jpg"></p>
<p>But it's the cinematography that is the real star, gripping and compelling
throughout, every scene lent a terrible beauty. Several minutes-long
handheld camera shots demonstrate fearsome logistical preparations
behind the camera, providing some battle scenes that are as intense,
immersive and terrifying as those from Saving Private Ryan, without
needing the gore.</p>
<p>Rating: 9/10.
A stunning film, compelling and emotionally harrowing, only falling
short of a magic '10' by virtue of lacking a real life-changing message.</p>

    <p>My exposure to test-driven software development at Resolver Systems has
resulted in a tremendous enthusiasm for the idea. Doubtless a
significant proportion of my zeal stems from my own over-compensation
for arriving late to this particular party, but nevertheless, I truly
believe that it's the most significant evolution the craft of software
engineering has had in decades. For thirty years we've had good reason
to believe Brooks' assertion that there will be no silver bullet, and
now I can't shake the feeling that this is the closest thing to it that
we'll ever have any right to expect.</p>
<p>After hearing suggestions from
<a href="http://andrzejonsoftware.blogspot.com">Andrzej</a> on improving our use of
mock objects in our unit tests, I did a little reading around the ideas
he mentioned. One of the best essays I found was Martin Fowler's piece,
entitled <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">mock objects aren't
stubs.</a></p>
<p><img alt="Mock classes used in unit tests as stubs." src="files/2007/04/mocks-arent-stubs.png"><em>Class UnderTest, shown on the left in use by release software, and on the
right in a test environment, using stubbed out mock helper classes.</em></p>
<p>Clearly, the idea of a generic mock object class isn't a brand-new one,
and Martin's essay describes several such utilities that have been
around for various lengths of time, but it is something I hadn't really
thought about until this week. We do use mock objects in our tests at
Resolver, in the sense of stub classes. When our class-under-test calls
methods on other 'adjacent' classes, then the test will first substitute
some mock object, often defined on the spot, to replace the adjacent
class. This decoupling of the class-under-test from other adjacent
classes keeps the tests simple and orthogonal.</p>
<p>If these mock objects had no methods on them, then the class under test
would barf when it tried to call methods on the mock. So we add empty
stub methods on the mock, to mimic the method names present on the
adjacent class it replaces.</p>
<p>This conventional kind of test works well. State changes within the
object-under-test can easily be asserted. Also, state changes to other,
mocked objects cannot be directly tested, since the simple stub mocks
described above maintain no internal state. In a way, this is fortunate,
since such state changes to adjacent objects should not be tested, or at
least not by the test under discussion. Those state changes should be
implemented by method calls on the adjacent objects, and tested in the
adjacent object's own unit test instead.</p>
<p>However, this only emphasises how important it is that, as well as our
own state changes, we should also be testing the behaviour of our
object-under-test by asserting that it makes the correct method calls to
adjacent objects. Not all method calls should be tested though - they
can be split into two categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Method calls made to calculate state changes in the current
    object-under-test.</li>
<li>Method calls made to inform other objects that they need to update
    their own internal state.</li>
</ol>
<p>Method calls belonging to the second category need to be explicitly
tested for. At Resolver we often implement such tests using a 'Listener'
test pattern, which can be used to assert that a given method on an
adjacent object was called with the correct arguments. Martin's essay
describes a generic mock object class that can be instructed to assert
that particular methods on it were called with particular parameters,
and this seems like a convenient pattern, particularly the methods which
create appropriately named stub methods on the mock object based upon a
given class. We could, I think, use this idea at Resolver in places, if
only to cut down on the manual creation of stubbed-out mock classes
throughout our test code.</p>
<p>However, the method of testing-by-behaviour that Martin describes does
not seem to always be applicable. The first of the two categories of
method calls above can and should be tested for by looking soley at the
resultant state changes in the object-under-test. It is these state
changes which are important, not the methods used to effect them.
Asserting that various helper classes were used to make an internal
state change only makes the test needlessly brittle to alternative
implementations that achieve the same result.</p>

    <p><em>PC, Mod of Half-Life 2. By Adam Foster, 2006.</em></p>
<p><img alt="Title screen" src="files/2007/04/metastasis_1_background0000.jpg">]</p>
<p>So the digital ink is barely dry on my assertions that videogames have
problems telling a story, when what should fall into my lap but one of
those rare and immaculate counter-examples to shut me right up.
<a href="http://www.hylobatidae.org/minerva/">Minerva: Metastatis</a> is a
bedroom-coded Half-Life 2 (HL2) mod that develops a storyline set within
the HL2 universe, a new thread in the tale of the alien Combine's
invasion of Earth. It has been three years in the making, and it's
<em>bloody brilliant</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="files/2007/04/metastasis_10004.jpg"></p>
<p>The baseline HL2 gameplay is not changed one iota. Metastasis eschews
the normal stock-in-trade of the mod scene, introducing no new enemies,
no new weapons, no new assets such as bitmaps or sound effects. Instead,
it envelops the player in an enthralling atmospheric experience, with a
compelling back-story and superb player motivation, using a sublime
combination of architecture, geometric composition, intensely creative
injected textual fragments and well-considered use of music. This is
backed up by the superbly crafted accompanying
<a href="http://www.hylobatidae.org/minerva/">website</a>, that does its best to
misinform and manipulate, drawing upon the best of various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game">alternate
reality game</a>
influences.</p>
<p><img alt="Shoreline" src="files/2007/04/metastasis_10012.jpg"></p>
<p><span style="background:#bb2200; color:white; border-radius: 1em; padding-left: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em; padding-top: 2px;">spoilers</span></p>
<p>The game opens with your character dumped unceremoniously out of a
helicopter by forces unknown, onto a beach under hostile fire. Running
for cover is the only option. Once out of immediate danger, your plight
is revealed in stages by a series of messages squirted onto your
protective suit's HUD by some agency identifying themselves as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva">Minerva</a>, as in the Roman Goddess
of crafts and wisdom, a.k.a, as
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Snow-Crash-Bantam-Spectra-Book/dp/0553380958">Stephenson</a>
would have it, the Goddess of technology. Minerva's communications are
enigmatic and aloof. You are being used as her sentient reconnaissance
tool, your experiences relayed back to her remote location, that she
might investigate a small island, and its role in the Combine's
occupation.</p>
<p><img alt="Down the rabbit hole" src="files/2007/04/metastasis_20021.jpg"></p>
<p>The island plays host to the usual menagerie of HL2 critters, and
visible at its centre is a mysterious plasma discharge, which Minerva
prompts you to investigate. Clambering down, underground, you discover
the crumbling remains of old WWII fortifications, now housing the
twisted, unearthly technology of the Combine's invading forces. From
there on, things only get stranger and larger by degrees, until the
moment when even Minerva's cool begins to break, and you are left
feeling very much like an ant in a nuclear power station, with little
option but to continue exploring until the exterminators show up.</p>
<p>It's short and sweet - I played through the first and second parts in a
single night. But it's managed with such finesse, extending the
back-story of HL2 in bold new directions, building upon what was
indubitably the greatest PC game of 2005, possibly of all time, with
such verve and imagination that I have to agree with a Metastasis forum
posting: It might just be (<em>whisper it</em>) better than the source.</p>
<p>Rating: 10/10.
Bring on the third and final instalment, due later this month...</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Last week was full of great artistic experiences, but none so sublime as
these two masterpieces, which I was lucky enough to witness and
complete, respectively, in the last few days. For reasons that I'm sure
need no explanation, I've opted to review them side-by-side in a single
post.</p>
<p><strong>History</strong></p>
<p></p>
<center>
<img alt="" src="files/2007/03/nes_super_mario_bros.png"><br><em>Pushkin's original novel, seen here in the English translation.</em>
</center>
<br><p>The story of Onegin derives from a Russian novel-in-verse, <em>Eugene
Onegin</em> written by Aleksandr Pushkin over the period from 1823 to 1837.
It was considered a classic of Russian literature, well-loved enough to
be quoted from memory by most Russians. Forty years later, Tchaikovsky
and Konstantin Shilovsky created the music and libretto respectively for
an operatic version of the same tale. This opera was then choreographed
as a ballet by Cranko in 1965, and it is Stolze's 2007 arrangement of
this that is now playing at the Royal Opera House in London's Covent
Garden.</p>
<p></p>
<center>
<img alt="" src="files/2007/03/eugeneonegin-book.jpg"><br><em>Super Mario Bros. on the NES</em>
</center>
<br><p>New Super Mario Bros, similarly, represents the culmination of a
venerated franchise. The character of Mario first appeared as a nameless
16x16 pixel carpenter in the vintage arcade hit <em>Donkey Kong</em> (1981),
and was then retooled as a plumber and christened for <em>Mario Bros.</em>
(1983). The core gameplay mechanics of the Mushroom Kingdom were not
formulated until <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> (1985), but have formed backbone to
the series ever since. Mario has adapted nimbly to several new
generations of home consoles and handhelds, but the most significant
technical evolution came with <em>Super Mario 64</em> (1996), which made a
superlative triumph out of the difficult transition to 3D, one that
continues to stymie many of his
<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2006-12-13-what-funk-is-sega-in.html">contemporaries</a>
even to this day. Meanwhile, Mario continues to form the iconic mainstay
character in what is generally recognised as the most successful, and
certainly the most influential, videogame series of all time.</p>
<p><strong>Form</strong></p>
<p></p>
<center>
<img alt="" src="files/2007/03/jump.jpg"><br><em>Flawlessly timed triple jumps result in extra height.</em>
</center>
<br><p>Like so many other DS outings, New Super Mario Bros. is very much a
return to form for the champion platformer. It makes solid, competent
use of the DS's dual screens and touch-sensitive technology, and brings
together the highlights of its distinguished lineage: peerless standards
of level design; an endearing levity; crisp, unambiguous graphics; a
roster of nostalgically well-known characters with their various
abilities and affiliations, and of course the pixel-perfect precision of
control that is the very embodiment of Mario. On top of the traditional
2D Mario mechanics, Nintendo have applied their usual expertise,
seamlessly incorporating moves from <em>Super Mario 64</em> et al, enriching
and polishing the control scheme, while never complicating it.
Wall-jumps, a ground-pound, and a triple-jump, complete with a couple of
cheerily superficial somersaults. Never has a controller been so
unintimidatingly overloaded with kinetic potential - latent at at first,
but blossoming by the third act, when Tatiana, now grown into a charming
and sophisticated woman, introduces her husband, Prince Gremin.</p>
<p><strong>Narrative</strong></p>
<p>Both works have in common the attempt to convey a narrative without the
aid of verbiage, with significant difficulties encountered in each case.</p>
<p></p>
<center>
<img alt="" src="files/2007/03/1703471_onegin_150a.jpg"><br><em>Dumb, as in mime.</em>
</center>
<br><p>Ballet suffers from an inexpressiveness in this regard, insomuch as the
tools at the dancer's disposal are not capable of depicting much in the
way of nuanced or fine-grained detail outside of particular,
well-trodden areas. Characters may meet, part, or die, and express all
manner of elation or sorrow as they go about it, but there are only a
limited number of stories that can be told from such components. It is
difficult to imagine, say, a political thriller, or even something as
familiar and staid as a murder mystery being told without resorting to
<em>Spandau</em> ballet. Because of this, the medium as a whole seems to have
become something of a creative cul-de-sac, preoccupied with retelling
the same formulaic stories over and over again - and even these are
considered to be in need of supplementing with a written synopsis in the
program.</p>
<p></p>
<center>
<img alt="" src="files/2007/03/newsupermario.jpg"><br><em>Disrupting the narrative direction.</em>
</center>
<br><p>Similarly, videogames revolve around the participation of the player,
who thus has the means to disrupt any narrative direction or pacing
anticipated by the game designer. Whatever story can be told, must
perforce be introduced either by the forced insertion of jarringly
ungamelike exposition, during which the player is frustratingly robbed
of any real input, or else must be told using the limited demonstrative
repertoire of in-game action. New Super Mario Bros. sidesteps these
difficulties by eschewing all but the most perfunctory storyline, aside
from a grown-up nod to the sordid realities behind Bowser's recurrent
princess kidnapping, hinted at by Bowser Jr. labouring under the
impression than Princess Peach may be his mother.</p>
<p><strong>Overall Impressions</strong></p>
<p>Despite their weaknesses, each of these works represents a good, solid
entry in representing the best that the mainstream of their respective
fields have to offer. Two marvellous, vigorous and thoroughly enjoyable
outings.</p>
<p><strong>Onegin</strong>
Rating 8/10.
