<p>I have a
<a href="https://www.coolermaster.com/catalog/peripheral/keyboards/ck530/">CoolerMaster CK530</a>
mechanical keyboard, which I love. It might have come with a small printed
manual, but if it did, I no longer have it, and I'm failing to find one online.
Here's are some things I've gleaned from experimentation.
If there's a manual I've overlooked, or if you have corrections,

<p>The <a href="https://coolermaster.egnyte.com/dl/8NuIc843wQ/?">Quickstart guide</a>
provides a list of key strokes, but no explanations. I've reproduced
the table here, with tweaks for understandability, and added more descriptions
below.</p>

<p>Many of these are self-explanatory. For the rest:</p>
<h3>Using modes</h3>
<p><code>fn</code> is the "coolermaster" key, on the bottom row key between right Windows and
right Ctrl.</p>
<p>When holding <code>fn</code>, several keys might light up, depending on the current
mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>ESC/1/2/3/4</code> - one of these keys flashes white to show which profile
  (see <a href="posts/keyboard-coolermaster-ck530s-missing-manual/#profiles">below</a>) is currently in use.</li>
<li>If the current mode allows you to select a color to use, then <code>F2/F3/F4</code>
  will light up to show the currently selected color's levels of
  red/green/blue.</li>
<li>If the current mode allows <em>two</em> colors to be set (foreground &amp; background),
  then one of <code>F6/F7</code> will flash white, to show which is currently affected. (See <a href="posts/keyboard-coolermaster-ck530s-missing-manual/#foreground-and-background-colors">below</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Pressing <code>fn + F5</code> cycles through:</p>

<p>Modes marked "reactive" react to keypresses. Mostly this lights up a pattern
around the pressed key. In the case of "snake", you can play using the arrow
keys.</p>
<p><span id="foreground-and-background-colors"></span></p>
<h3>Foreground &amp; background colors</h3>
<p>Many of the modes have a foreground effect that you can change the color of.
For example, in the <em>all-one-color</em> mode (officially called "static")
you can select the color with which all keys are lit, using <code>fn + F2/F3/F4</code>.</p>
<p>Some of the modes also have a second color, the background, that you can set
separately. You can see if a mode offers this by selecting the mode and holding
<code>fn</code>. If this mode offers two settable colors, then either <code>F6</code> or <code>F7</code> will
flash white, to show you which one you are currently setting.</p>
<p>Press <code>fn + F6/F7</code> to choose foreground or background,
then use <code>fn + F2/F3/F4</code> to set it.</p>
<p><span id="custom-mode"></span></p>
<h3>Custom mode</h3>
<p>Custom (mode #6 above) lets the user assign a different color to each key.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, cycle through modes using <code>fn + F5</code> until you reach custom mode.
   It can be tricky to identify when you've reached it. Use the list of modes
   above to help.</li>
<li>While in custom mode, press <code>fn + F10</code> to edit key colors.</li>
<li>Select a color using <code>fn + F2/F3/F4</code>.</li>
<li>Press all the keys you want lit in the selected color. Pressing the same key
   again turns it unlit.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 3 &amp; 4 for other color/key combinations.</li>
<li>Finally, save to your current profile (see <a href="posts/keyboard-coolermaster-ck530s-missing-manual/#profiles">below</a>) by holding
   <code>fn</code> and pressing your current profile key (whichever of <code>Esc/1/2/3/4</code> is
   flashing white.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Some wrinkles:</p>
<p>I can't manage to set a color for the FN key itself, which always appears unlit
in this mode.</p>
<p>The caps lock key is unlit in this mode, unless caps lock is on.
Similarly, scroll lock seems to always be unlit for me in this mode,
although it is lit in other modes.</p>
<p>When you try to assign a color to whichever one of <code>Esc/1/2/3/4</code> is lit white,
to indicate the active profile, then nothing visible happens, but it is
working. You have to save, or cancel key color editing by loading a different
profile.
Then you can see whether you successfully assigned the color,
or pressed the key one too many times and left it unlit.</p>
<p>While editing key colors, if you wait, without exit/saving, pressing nothing
for a minute or so, then it cancels all your changes since step 2.</p>
<p><span id="profiles"></span></p>
<h3>Profiles</h3>
<p>There are five "profiles", each of which can be used to save the current
state of the keyboard.</p>
<p>The profiles are accessed using <code>fn + 1/2/3/4/Esc</code>. <code>Esc</code> is the "default"
profile. I don't know what this means. (When turning the keyboard on, ie.
plugging the USB cable into a computer, the last active profile is restored,
so it isn't that.)</p>
<p>The current profile is shown when you hold <code>fn</code>, by one of <code>1/2/3/4/Esc</code>
flashing white. While keeping FN pressed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pressing the flashing profile key will save the keyboard state to your
  current profile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pressing any of the other profile keys will LOAD that profile,
  losing the current keyboard state.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, to save changes to an arbitrary profile, you need to select that
profile <em>before</em> making the changes.</p>
<p>Each profile saves the configuration of every mode, plus it remembers which
mode is currently selected. Are macros stored in a profile? Don't know.</p>

<p><em>by Chris DeLeon (2018)</em></p>
<p>Roman Emperor Marcus Auralias' notes, traditionally titled <em>Meditations</em>,
are a foundational text for practical Stoicism. They comprise a multitude of
observations and recommendations, grouped into sections such as "Keeping
thoughts tranquil", and "Cooperation, collaberation and contribution". They
offer advice for living a contented life, with less regret, sorrow, anger and
fear.</p>
<p>Several translations exist, themselves dated from through the ages. This book
combines them, to synthesize a text which doesn't hew as precisely to the
original as a straight translation might, but is instead intended to have the
most relevance to modern ears.</p>
<p>Confession: It's taken me <em>months</em> to get through it. Partly this is because
I've allowed myself to be distracted by more gaudy and immediate books along
the way. Partly it's because I found the best way to read this was <em>slowly</em>.
Practically every paragraph is worth reflecting upon, to consider how it
applies to my own life, and ponder what practical, specific next steps are
implied.</p>
<p>If I had to criticize, it would only be the superficial wrinkle that there's
a lot of repetition, such as hundreds of suggestions to not fear death.
Apparently the original documents were accumulated over decades of Auralias'
life.</p>
<p>Genuinely life changing.</p>

<h4>The problem</h4>
<p>This year I was diagnosed with achalasia. It's a rare condition in which nerve
damage causes weak and poorly coordinated swallowing in the esophagus,
including a reluctance of the lower esophageal sphincter, leading to the
stomach, to properly relax at the appropriate moment.</p>
<p>This leads to difficulty swallowing, regurgitation, and a column of liquid
sitting in the esophagus, which becomes distended, losing elasticity and tone.
The cause of the nerve damage is unknown, and has probably been accumulating
for decades. It's reasonable to assume this is mixed up in some way with
various ailments of my guts over the years (celiac, eosinophilic esophagitis,
chronic hiccups), but causal relationships are unknown.</p>
<h4>A solution, of sorts</h4>
<p>Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a surgical procedure intended to allow the
esophagus to drain properly, avoiding further distension. Surgery happens
through a tube down the throat, from where they cut into the muscle wall of the
oesophagus, then tunnel down to the outside of the lower esophageal sphincter.
There, they cut some of the muscle, making the sphincter less tightly clenched,
so that food can pass more easily.</p>
<p>For me, my symptoms were a nuisance, but perfectly endurable. The main goal
of the procedure was preventative - reduction in future damage to my esophagus.
Plus, there's an outside chance that maybe eliminating that standing fluid
might improve other matters, such as reducing irritation which maybe causes my
hiccups? Long shot, but worth a try.</p>
<p>There's a lot of information given to the patient through the process, but
these are the things that were still surprises to me.</p>
<h4>Day 0. The procedure.</h4>
<p>I've undergone a lot of regular endoscopic inspections or biopsies. At some
point, in London's splendid Imperial College Hospital, I discovered the cheat
code is to ask to do these unsedated. It's a few minutes of slightly
nightmarish discomfort, to watch a burly gentleman hand-over-hand several feet
of black rubber garden hose directly into your mouth. But the payoffs are that
without any anesthetic, there's no need to fast, the procedure itself is
simpler and safer, and best of all, recovery time is much reduced. Given a
few minutes to compose yourself, you can cycle or drive yourself home right
afterwards, making it a 45 minute appointment, instead of writing off most of
the day.</p>
<p>However, going unsedated for the more substantial POEM obviously isn't an
option. It requires more than the simple sedation I've experienced before,
since apparently there's a phase at the end where they check you're regaining
consciousness and are able to breathe for yourself before they remove the
apparatus that's been breathing for you while you are paralyzed for the
procedure. This is the sort of detail that is kindly elided from the regular
patient briefing, which only came up because we were asking questions.</p>
<p>I only remember coming around sometime after that point, and my first thought,
unplanned, was to test whether I could perform square and cube roots in my
head. Apparently that's my brain's idea of a power-on self test. I could do
small integers, like 27 -&gt; 3, but had the presence of mind enough to see that's
just relying on remembered sequences. I was able to envision the process to do
the calculation for something which isn't a cube, like 28, but I failed to
actually execute any iterations of it.</p>
<p>I said hello to a nurse sat beside me, but resisted the urge to chatter at her
about my mental state. Somehow, even I could see that from her perspective,
that would be like talking to drunk people. So now I'm doing it at you instead.</p>
<p>After a while they rolled me into my own room, and stuck a big pad over my
butt. <em>Foreshadowing!</em> I fuzzily thought. I stayed in hospital overnight, for
tests the next day. Forever grateful for Suze's visits even though I wasn't
the best of company. :-)</p>
<p>My hiccups didn't reappear through the first few hours of my recovery, even
though I spent the time propped upright in bed. This is pretty unusual - they
usually return within seconds of me sitting up. But when they did return, they
were pretty painful. What I call "hiccups" is partly a spasm of the esophagus
itself - precisely where I'd just been cut and then clamped and sutered back
together. So I asked the nurse to dial up the pain meds, at first with breezy
British grit, and then with increasingly wild eyes and white knuckles
as they took a while to figure out a few local administrative issues, like
where the person with the keys to the drugs locker had gone. Rode out the rest
of the day in style.</p>
<h4>Day 1. Restart the line</h4>
<p>I'd brought a bunch of things for my two day hospital stay, books and media and
headphones and my own cozy pajamas to wear while garrulously socializing with
staff and adjacent patients. That was all a total waste of time. I was a write
off the entire time I was there, not able to muster the bandwidth even to watch
t.v. I saw a single episode of Schitt's Creek at one point because Suze kindly
propped it up in front of me, but I couldn't manage a 2nd. I just dozed, and
was wheeled to a barium x-ray, to check I wasn't leaking anywhere untoward.</p>
<p>At some point during this day, my digestive tract started up again. It became
apparent that it had just been on strike, inactive, since the surgery. I felt
it ripple distressingly back into action, along with some impressive gurgles.
The big pad they'd stuck on me the day before turned out not to be vital in
this instance, but I can very much understand how it often might be.</p>
<p>The nurse introduced me to a plastic device for measuring and exercising my
ability to inhale deeply, on which I could occasionally surpass the initial
expectation of 1,000 points.</p>
<p>My ambitions for the day were to get out of bed and take a 2 minute walk, and
later in the day to tolerate my first drinks, some water and fruit juices,
sufficiently to get approved to go home. Leaving hospital with some
prescription, gluten free, clear liquid pain killers proved to be an impossible
administrative nightmare. Nobody's fault, the system is broken. The concept of
"insurance" for healthcare is inherently dysfunctional.</p>
<h4>Day 2. Home again</h4>
<p>At home for five days of a clear liquid diet. This means water, strained fruit
juices &amp; drinks without suspensions (i.e. no particles floating in it to make
it opaque), tea or coffee without milk, clear broths. Also, slightly bizarrely,
jell-o, since it may be eaten while solid, but at room (or body) temperature,
it's a liquid. I demurred on Suze's threat to make jello shots.</p>
<p>Ambitions for today were to rise from the sofa for a shower, and a walk or two
around the inside of the house. Scoring 1,500 points on the breathe-o-meter.
Importantly, I now have it together enough to be able to watch some dumb t.v.</p>
<h4>Day 3. Outdoors.</h4>
<p>Ambitions today were to take a walk or two around our yard. Scoring 2,000
points on the breathe-o-meter! Yay, progress. Able to concentrate enough to
read.</p>
<h4>Day 4.</h4>
<p>Ambitions today were to take a couple of walks around the block. Scoring 3,500
points on the breathe-o-meter. I have no idea what my baseline was.</p>
<h4>Day 5.</h4>
<p>First full day and night without any pain killers. Ambitions for today were to
take it easy and not mow the lawn (check!). Might have to get someone in to do
it for us. I'd be writhing in guilt if Suze had to go out and manhandle our
temperamental mower around. 4,500 on the breathe-o-meter.</p>
<h4>Day 6.</h4>
<p>Back to work - from home, at a desk.</p>
<p>Over lunch I visit the hospital for an x-ray and more tests. I was hoping to
graduate to a soft food diet today, but surgeon says that, although he's happy
with my progress, out of an abundance of caution he's going to keep me on clear
liquids until day 9. Then a soft food diet for six weeks. C'est la vie. Back
home to more apple juice. At least I'm still under instructions to take it
easy, so retain my excuse for not mowing the lawn...</p>

<p><em>by Jason Shiga (2016)</em></p>
<p>I'm just discovering the works of <a href="http://www.shigabooks.com">Jason Shiga</a>,
creator of mathematically-inspired nonlinear comic-books, e.g. stories drawn
on complex origami structures, that can be folded in various ways to represent
either branching storylines, or else to manage state such as 'inventory'.
Construction of these more elaborate paper constructions doesn't scale,
(ie. I'm not likely to ever own one) but you can try some of his other
creations on the web.</p>
<p>This is <a href="http://www.shigabooks.com/index.php?page=001">Demon</a>,
a regular linear webcomic.</p>
<p>The storyline is 'math-inspired' too, in the same way that the movie <em>Primer</em>
is - intense, absolute, ruthless, narrative exploration of logical
implications, while continually, dizzyingly, escalating to the next level.</p>

<p>Another fabulously enjoyable science fiction adventure from qntm. Like their
other novels, it does a tremendous job of exploring the implications and
consequences of big science fiction concepts.</p>
<p>In this case, it's a story of human superheroes, whose powers derive from
beings-beyond-comprehension, from the high-dimensional multiverse, the
Structure, within which our paltry three-plus-one spacetime is naught but an
embedded decal. Their struggles rewrite the fundamental physics of our
universe, to fashion it into an inescapable trap, denying humanity access to
advanced sciences, and to communion with the higher levels of the Structure.
Loved it.</p>
<p>For those like me with an epub fetish, you can buy <em>Fine Structure</em> in many
formats, including Amazon links, EPUBs, or free-to-read online, <a href="https://qntm.org/structure">at the

<p>It took me a few pages to shift gears to match the provocatively casual style,
but once I did, it quickly became an engrossing and endearing read.
The book collects a series of tiny but grand adventures, each riffing on one
of the titular Ed's fabulous new inventions or discoveries. Together these
form an arc which burns through combinations of high-concept SF ideas at an
unseemly rate.</p>
<p>It reminded me of what I've fondly said about 200AD (the galaxy's greatest
comic), that somehow the superficiality of the medium allows
writers to experiment more wildly with form and content, throwing up a torrent
of creativity which, while sometimes uneven, generates moments of sheer
brilliance. I thought being a comic was an essential part of that formula. But
<em>Ed</em> proves me wrong by achieving the same velocity of verve and vigor,
rendered in prose. A delight.</p>
<p>The Epilogue reminds me gleefully of
<a href="https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/a/151964/13496">this stackoverflow worldbuilding answer</a>
I gave a few months ago.</p>

<p>I bought all four of <a href="https://qntm.org/fiction">qntm's books</a>
when I discovered the fantastic
<a href="posts/there-is-no-antimemetics-division/">There is no Antimemetics Division</a>.
I didn't really expect to like all of them, sight unseen, but was delighted to
support an emerging author who had contributed to the genius of SCP. But then
the books that arrived turned out to be bloody brilliant.</p>
<p>This one tells a tale in which magic was discovered to be real in the 1970s,
becoming a new, arcane branch of physics. From there, it piles on the twists
and raises the stakes at an enthralling and dizzying rate, demanding the
reader to keep up through many exciting layered reveals and escalating changes
of perspective. Absolutely smashing.</p>
<p>Like <em>Antimemetics</em>, it scores points with me for including some female heroes,
who surmount challenges through some striking strengths of character &amp;
expertise, rather than simply being the best at applied violence.</p>

<ul>
<li>I got most crypto energy use from <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/05/21098323/elon-musk-says-tesla-looking-at-other-cryptos-who-use-less-than-1-of-bitcoins-energy-which">this roundup</a>.</li>
<li>For Visa, I used the figures from <a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption">this breakdown</a>.</li>
<li>For Bitcoin, I took a rounded figure roughly between those quoted on the above two sources
  (710kWh and 1,123kWh). A single figure precision is probably most appropriate anyhow.</li>
<li>For Chia, I did my own hacky calculation.
  <a href="https://chiapower.org/">Chia Power estimates 6MW</a>
  in total is used by the Chia network, at current size of 4EiB.
  Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/transaction-volume">Chia Explorer shows a hard-to-read graph</a>
  which I'm eyeballing to get a rough average of 3,000 transactions per hour.
  6 Megawatts divided by 3k per hour gives an energy use per transaction
  of 2kW.</li>
<li>For equivalent household energy uses, I used <a href="https://electricityplans.com/kwh-kilowatt-hour-can-power/">this</a> and <a href="http://www.wrecc.com/what-uses-watts-in-your-home/">this</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Something's not quite right here though. The Chia whitepaper estimates 10,000
times better energy efficiency than Bitcoin, by my figures above only show
1,000.</p>
<p>They probably know how to calculate this better than I do. So perhaps my figure
for Chia is high? I understand the value per transaction will come down as
Chia starts handling more transactions, which seems reasonable. Perhaps the
white paper refers to that future hypothetical efficiency?</p>
<p>On the other hand, many of the other cryptocurrencies listed above will
become more efficient in the future too (e.g. Bitcoin is in the process
of deploying its lightning network, which will reduce per transaction
energy use.)  So I think it's fair to leave the above figures as they are,
as a snapshot of current reality.</p>

<p>Prompted by a conversation at work about favorite time travel stories,
I snagged this from the library.</p>
<p>English school teacher Jake is roped into a dying man's plot to exploit a
mechanism of travelling back to 1958, from which, with many complications, he
waits out the intervening few years in order to prevent JFK's assassination.</p>
<p>I found it a page turner, certainly. But nonetheless I was slightly
disappointed, perhaps because of my reverence for such a successful author, who
I haven't actually read since my teens. Expectations of mastery clashed with
what, for me, felt like lowest-common-denominator style.</p>
<p>King knows exactly what he intends - to use time travel as a hook on which to
hang a human tale of drama, aspiration and loss. He has no interest in my
personal predilections, such as messing with the logical conundrums of his
chosen time-travel mechanic, and he declares this straightforwardly. When the
main character asks "But what if I end up killing my own Grandfather?", his
mentor shoots him a look of incomprehension, replying "Why in hell would you
want to do a thing like that?" Subject closed, and fair enough.</p>
