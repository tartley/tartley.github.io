<p>An unpolished quickie : I'm typing over a dinner plate.</p>
<p>Twitter is brilliant, amazing, game-changing, revolutionary. It's
winning features have been discussed to death, I don't need to analyse
that here. But it has a couple of really glaring failures.</p>
<p>For one, it's impossibly inconvenient to reconstruct a conversation
between two people if you don't follow both of them. So your friend is
having a conversation with someone you don't know, and it's on your
favourite topic, and you can't really meaningfully participate, nor even
easily historically reconstruct the conversation. It sucks.</p>
<p>For two, it's single-channel only. You can't send a tweet to a subset of
your followers. If you want to tweet about personal stuff to your
daytime friends, and tweet about programming stuff to your geek friends,
and about party stuff to your pervert friends, you have to set up
separate twitter accounts for each group, and have everyone follow the
appropriate sub-selection. So hard to manage that nobody does it with a
granularity of greater than two. Most people don't even do it at all. So
everyone's signal-to-noise is ramped way up, because the topic you
follow anyone for is diluted by all the other shit going on in their
life, most of which you usually couldn't give two fucks about.</p>
<p>Fixing both of these would be REALLY frakking awesome. Would really
expose all the nebulous potential that Twitter users can see right there
just beyond reach. Twitter itself won't do it - they are too afraid of
souring the magic sauce that has given them such amazing penetration. So
expect a Twitter-killer, sometime this year. Incorporating some sort of
equivalent of chat rooms or private channels.</p>
<p>Funny thing is, once you do that, what you're left with starts to look
an awful lot like IRC. Like the man on BSG says "All of this has
happened before, and will happen again, and again, and again."</p>

(login reqd). Overdue, and in the third person. Deal.</p>
<p>1. As a child, Jonathan used to sit and read from novels and fat
encyclopaedias every day for hours on end, while licking his finger and
dipping it in the family sugar bowl.</p>
<p>2. Jonathan is
<a href="http://ebbs.english.vt.edu/exper/kcramer/anth/Pi.html">compelled</a> to
either court or ditch people he meets, purely to keep the number of
active friends currently in his life a prime number.</p>
<p>3. In his late twenties, Jonathan took to applying neat turpentine to
his scalp so that his bald head would make him look more intelligent and
academic.</p>
<p>4. As Jonathan writes this, he is wearing <a href="http://thesuze.com/">his
wife</a>'s jeans. They are at once too tight and too
loose in various unfamiliar places.</p>
<p>5. Jonathan named his pet rabbit Benny, after his brother. When we found
out about the skin cancer we had Benny put down straight away. It wasn't
until a full eight weeks later that Jonathan finally got an appointment
to have his tumour removed.</p>
<p>6. Jonathan distinctly remembers an innocuous seeming moment when he was
twelve years old. Doing math homework. Somehow or other he knew that the
answers he kept getting were wrong. He was hacking away at it,
determined to figure out his mistake, when suddenly, out of the blue, he
had a small realisation. He could just submit the exercise with the
wrong answers intact. It wouldn't matter one iota. He would get a few
questions marked wrong, but would still be in the top handful of people
in the class, and that would be that. Nobody would ever know that he
hadn't tried his absolute hardest. Regardless of whether one interprets
it as the onset of slackerdom or as joyously claiming his own freedom of
will, academically it was all downhill from that moment.</p>
<p>7. As a child Jonathan loved ice skating, although you'd never know it
to see him now. He was put off it by an accident on the rink when aged
about 12, which left him house-bound for three months, waiting for his
prosthetic ear to take.</p>
<p>8. Jonathan's first job after graduation was R&amp;D on systems to analyse
radar echoes. As well as perennially hot-button topics like
identification of 'non-co-operative' aircraft, other applications
included the early detection of hairline cracks in the internal blades
of jet engines, without having to actually take the engine apart. In
simulating the typical damage a jet engine suffers, for a few hot sticky
days in the summer of '94, Jonathan got to be the guy who tossed thawed
supermarket chickens into the shrieking intake maw of various Rolls
Royce low-bypass turbofans.</p>
<p>9. Jonathan's favourite food is Christmas pudding (in England, a dense
moist alcoholic fruit cake, you wouldn't like it), although this
probably has some unfair weighting in the grand scheme of comparative
gastronomics, due to the traditionally prescribed infrequency of its
ingestion. Next up would be good (not medium) sushi. While I'm being
picky, can I also echo Douglas Adam's exhortation that tea should only
be made using water which is <em>boiling</em>, not boiled.</p>
<p>10. Jonathan hypothesizes that the normal operation of the human mind's
stream of conciousness must include a supervisory mechanism, to detect
and inhibit recursive or cyclic patterns of thought, viz. thoughts that
trigger a chain of associations causing the original thought to
re-occur. It is clearly useful for us to be briefly reminded of all
related concepts whenever a new stimulus hoves into view. Equally
clearly, it would be disastrous if we were to mentally bounce back and
forth between two or more closely related concepts, each reminding us of
the other in rapid succession, <em>ad infinitum</em>. The chain of associations
must be damped down once each related concept has been highlighted in
our awareness. Jonathan further postulates that one of the effects of
certain mind-altering substances, and of some mental illnesses, is to
inhibit this inhibitory mechanism. In such a state, the host mind is
unable to maintain a train of thought or singularity of purpose, since
every step along the conceptual route is strewn with tar-pits of
associations, trapping the conciousness in a vegetative trance of cyclic
ideas, or else in a disturbingly repetitive cycle of behaviour.
Incoherent dysfunction such as this is an outward symptom of the
unblinkered mind's new-found ability to gaze, for the first time,
directly upon the face of an actual, literal infinity. The depth of
recursion only limited by the bandwidth of conceptual reverberation.
This results in sensations of considerable awe. Both the positive and
negative aspects of such a state are compounded by the common additional
effect of lowering the mind's threshold required for one concept to be
considered as 'related' to another. This leads to streams of
conciousness in which entirely unrelated or even contradictory ideas can
be subjectively perceived as not only being deeply related, but as
actually being identical. Hence black is white, false becomes true, life
is death, one is all and all is none. The feedback causes these thoughts
to occur with great intensity, lending them a feeling of spiritually
deep profundity. The subject's stereotypical inability to coherently
reformulate these ideas when sober is directly due to the fact that such
thoughts are, under normal circumstances, quite literally unthinkable,
except for the kind of indirect and abstract representation that comes
from merely describing them, as opposed to truly, deeply believing them.
(<strong>Update</strong>: These ideas had clearly been stirred up of late by my being
halfway through <a href="posts/infinite-jest"><em>Infinite
Jest</em></a> by David Foster
Wallace, a novel about addiction, related mental dysfunction and their
relationship to freedom of will. Imagine my lack of surprise, then, when
I reach page 1,048 (footnote 269, sub-footnote a, no joke) to discover
Wallace had already written a rant of his own, very similar to this one,
on 'labyrinths of reflexive abstraction', which he had clearly been
leading up to for a long time. Like, say, for most of his writing
career.)</p>
<p>11. Jonathan writes down his selections for the national lottery, but
never buys any tickets. To date, he has chosen the winning numbers five
times.</p>
<p>12. People who are into nice clothes are just pathetic beacons of
insecurity. I mean, all well and good to pick a nice color of (T-)shirt
off the rack if you're confronted with a rack from which to choose. Or
to dress up with your friends for a particular event, which is a giggle.
But if you're going to more effort than that, or if you propagate the
fallacy that your industry demands it, then you're a moron and I despise
everything you stand for. Ditto for expensive jewellery or nice watches
or fancy cars or all the other claptrap accoutrements with which people
distract themselves from a witheringly inadequate life. As I write this,
I'm planning to go out this afternoon to [accessorise ]{#query
.query}for a black tie event later tonight. Stabbed in the back by the
dark tides and treacherous undercurrents of my own very human psyche.
(<strong>Update:</strong> From my office, the windows overlook the preposterously
over-dressed Nathan-Barley-esque cavorting which takes place outside a
London fashion house.)</p>
<p>13. Jonathan enjoys stalking round the house naked when his housemates
aren't watching.</p>
<p>14. Jonathan very much enjoys dreams of flying, and notes that for him,
it requires a symbolic flapping of arms to supply a motive force, and an
appropriate arching of the body to pull off manoeuvres, not entirely
unlike the motions of snorkelling. Which he also loves.</p>
<p>15. Jonathan wishes his friends lived closer. On the same street would
be nice.</p>
<p>16. Jonathan should have set off for work ten minutes ago.</p>
<p>17. Jonathan is deeply envious of people who can juggle.</p>
<p>18. As has been remarked upon elsewhere, there's nothing quite like a
freshly-shaven scrotum. Truly breathtaking.</p>
<p>19. Jonathan has spent a few weeks learning about 500 digits of pi. The
world record is 67,890. (<strong>Update:</strong> The challenge for you is to
determine <em>which</em> 500 they are.)</p>
<p>20. Jonathan has only in recent years begun to realise that he isn't
actually a very good computer programmer after all. For the time being,
he consoles himself with the philosophy that understanding this is
probably a necessary step on the long road to enlightenment.</p>
<p>21. Jonathan would like to learn how to disagree with
[idio]{style="text-decoration: line-through;"}people more
constructively, without putting both them and himself on the defensive.
Was very impressed last week listening to <a href="http://iainsimons.com/2009/02/bafta-geeknight-2/">Iain
Simons</a> talk about
setting up the National Videogame Archive, who's response to some fairly
cutting criticism appeared to be a deep and abiding curiosity. (Although
when I tweeted him about the discussion afterwards he half-joked that
'of course I was boiling with rage inside') Nevertheless, this seems
like a very promising approach. How to nurture it?</p>
<p>22. Jonathan believes that if there was ever a God or Gods, it or they
have fucked right off, and don't seem to be coming back. We're on our
own in this. Get over it. However, he is very willing to entertain the
idea that the act of prayer or meditation may well be a helpful
psychological device, you can keep doing that if you wish. Just don't
dress it up with all your stupid bullshit. (Ah! Oh! I mean, I'm <em>deeply
curious</em> about how you reached these conclusions, please share your
enlightenment with me.)</p>
<p>23. Jonathan loves each and every one of you. Yes, even you.</p>
<p>24. Jonathan is beginning to realise that it is actually way more taxing
to write 25 false things about himself than it is to simply write 25
things about himself. He may have to mix and match. But can you tell
which ones are which, and identify the pattern in which they are
arranged?</p>
<p>25. Jonathan is trying to come to terms with the fact that people are
almost never able to consciously think in a rational way. I'm including
you in this derogatory generalisation, but that's OK, because I'm
including me too. This would all be fine if, as the startlingly
prescient and insightful <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/convergence.html">Paul
Graham</a> pointed out, ideas
were still just badges used to demonstrate affiliation. But nowadays
civilisation has given our ideas real leverage, such that the ideas we
choose to hold now actually have some effect on the world around us,
more than simply acting as banners under which social groups gather in
the voting alliances of human power struggles. Which, again, would all
be fine, if only we recognized all of this, and took account of it when
judging the worth of our own decisions and opinions. For the most part
though, we just wing it through modern life using the subconscious
instinctive emotional responses that have served humankind and its
animal forbears relatively well through all of prehistory. The relevance
of these instincts, though, and the value systems they have bequeathed
us, are now dwindling in the face of rapid changes to the world, wrought
by our overwhelming dominance over our environment, and our resultantly
multitudinous populations. The problems we face, both day-to-day as
individuals, and those which must be surmounted for the long term
survival of our species, are drastically different from any that we have
previously encountered. Our normal modes of operation will not suffice.
We rush forwards on behavioural inertia, destructively applying the
hard-won lessons of distant millennia, which taught us that survival
absolutely depends upon ruthless conquest over other species, and
dominance over our environment. However, these behaviours are no longer
in our best interests. In fact, they lead to a unhappiness, social
instability, and needless cruelty and destruction. To break the cycle of
escalating competition and subjugation as resources are depleted in an
increasingly crowded world, there is only one desirable solution. A
future in which everybody wins. Kindness and enlightenment spread across
the globe, allowing people to happily make best use of our limited
resources. This one solution is this: People are going to have to learn
to be rational. This is not going to be easy. The first step on the road
to wisdom is to acknowledge and embrace the fact that we are not,
unaided, capable of rational thought. We need to integrate checks and
balances into our decision making processes, both personally and
institutionally, in order to preserve and build upon any glimmers of
sanity in our outlook. There is already a name for living like this. It
is called <em>science</em>. Science is not wearing lab coats or slavish
adulation of technology. It does not mean an automatic refutation of
religion or creationism or any of its other traditional foes. Science is
inherently neither for nor against any particular politics, ideology or
lifestyle. It simply means to humbly question ourselves and our
innermost assumptions, to diligently maintain objectivity, and to let
our beliefs follow tentatively wherever the evidence leads us. Those who
distract from the truth by forcing their assumptions upon others, by
espousing their own party or special interest group, or encouraging the
adoption of deeply-held beliefs - they shall not be tolerated, and we
shall remove them utterly from the decision-making process. Only with
such discipline and dedication will we uncover the path to happiness,
save ourselves and fulfil humankind's manifest destiny. Come, wherever
you are, and kneel with me, kneel before the mighty altar of science,
saviour of us all. The geek shall truly inherit the Earth.</p>

<p><em>Directed: The Coen Brothers, 1996.</em></p>
<p>Some brilliant performances, some lovely moments. Emminently watchable.
Interesting point, I don't know about Fargo itself, or The Dakotas, but
the fine residents of Minnesota will insist that they neither sound or
act like the depicted characters, which is of course absolutely
charming. (love you guys! :-)</p>

<p><em>by Ray Bradbury (1953)</em></p>
<p>A tale of future urban America, in which political or critical thought
is suppressed by overwhelming popular entertainment and by burning all
books, told with Bradbury's typical simple and beautiful prose. Rarely
has a tale suffused me with such peace and tranquillity than my making
the transition from the frantic, advertising-saturated dystopia into the
moonlit fields and abandoned railroads of the closing chapters.</p>
<p>The novel has a curiously bifurcated message for modern times. We would
seem to be even more overwhelmed by noisy and crass distractions of
types unimaginable in Bradbury's time, often unable to pry ourselves
free from a myriad compelling sources of entertainment.</p>
<p>However, for all the negative impact this internet may have had on our
peace of mind and our attention spans, it has also provided tremendous
benefits that to a great extent defuse the novel's warnings. Books are
now infinitely reproduceable. Dissenting thought or new ideas can easily
be published and read by millions, free from fear of retribution by
employers or governments, those <a href="http://homes.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html">weary giants of flesh and
steel</a>. Writing by
any person in the world is routinely disseminated to and from the
furthest corners of the globe in seconds. Instantly findable. Free from
censorship. Archived forever. Unburnable.</p>
<p>This ease-of-use provides each of us with exactly what we demand of it.
Just as Bradbury foretells, those of a studious mind, those with
legitimate concerns, those with a desire to change the world or make
something more out of life, these people will always gather to talk and
plan and act. Only now, they can do so globally, instantly and
effectively. For each of us, our salvation requires only that we choose
to save ourselves.</p>
<p>Rating:</p>
<p>10/10 if you fancy a bit of charming retro SF with a beautiful turn of
phrase</p>
<p>0/10 if you think worrying about fulfilment in life, political affairs,
or meaning in life is a big waste of time, especially if it's done by
way of science-fiction metaphors and hyperthetical future scenarios.
Let's go shopping!</p>

<img alt="Phantom Hourglass" src="files/2008/05/phantom-hourglass.jpg"></span></p>
<p><em>Nintendo, 2008</em></p>
<p>Nintendo spin off a <em>fourteenth</em> iteration of the familiar and
oh-so-beloved franchise. I'd only previously played the
preposterously-sub-titled <em>Ocarina of Time</em> on the N64, of which I
retain fond, sepia-coloured memories.</p>
<p>I found <em>Phantom Hourglass</em> to be engaging, and played it to a
thoroughly jolly completion over the course of a couple of months. The
gameplay and plot are a tad more casual and lightweight than <em>Ocarina</em>,
as befitting play snatched while on-the-go on the handheld platform.</p>
<p>Using the DS stylus to control Link is delightfully transparent and
intuitive. Just as for a mouse, however, expert users will eventually
eschew it for many actions, preferring the speed, precision and
tactility of distinct physical buttons.</p>
<p>On the down side, some of the puzzles are downright contrived. After
introducing a handy little map, on which you can scrawl notes and
reminders for yourself, the game then promptly takes it away again for
<em>exactly</em> the levels on which it would be of most use, proclaiming 'you
can't use the map here, some sort of magic prevents it.' Right. Up
yours.</p>
<p>Equally intrusive, the dialog is entirely Nintendo-esque cutesy Japanese
schmultz, and it would have improved the game no end for it to have been
entirely absent.</p>
<p>Such niggles are few and far between, though. Time for another go of the
newfangled rating system.</p>
<p>Rating: Place yourself somewhere between...</p>
<p>10/10 if you're into a deftly executed handheld riff on the Zelda
series, beautifully integrated with the affordances and sensibilities of
the hosting hardware in that way that only Nintendo can do. Lots to love
here.</p>
<p>0/10 if you're done with revisiting timeworn ideas, even ones as
compelling and charming as this, and yearn for a resurgence in
experimental originality to kick the gaming industry out of one or two
ruts (such as having a blind spot for crappy dialog.)</p>

<p><em>Team ICO, PS2, 2005.</em></p>
<p>As is common for a title released in the autumn years of a console's
lifetime, the programmers at Team ICO have mastered the PS2 hardware,
and wring the utmost from it for this virtuoso performance.</p>
<p>The gameplay consists of nothing more than a series of sixteen boss
fights between your character and a succession of gigantic mythical
creatures, each rising from the landscape upon your approach. Half
stone, half furry flesh, these colossi shake the earth as they walk, and
facing up to them, armed with nothing but a sword and a bow, elicits a
genuine rush of fear, firstly as their size and magnificence become
apparent, then as they stand up, and then, finally, terrifyingly, as
they <em>see you</em>. Like moments from a piercing dream, playing this game is
an experience that will not be forgotten.</p>
<p>It's in this emotive ability that the game's strength lies, and the
initial adrenaline is only the most coarse example of it. Those disposed
to gallop directly in the hinted direction of the the next objective
would be missing out on large parts of what <em>Colossus</em> has to offer, and
would be well advised to ease back, enjoy the view, and take some
pleasure from the journey. For fully half your time will be spent
traversing this epic landscape in search of your next quarry, and the
landscape is fantastic, in every sense. Across open plains, rent by
canyons and gorges spanned by ancient, elegant arches, past thundering
waterfalls, though shafts of sunlight across boulder-strewn forest
floors. Cutting through mighty, vine-covered ruins, now occupied only by
lizards and hawks.</p>
<p>This tranquil exploration is punctuated by the excitement of the
battles, forming a delightful sense of anticipation. The battles
themselves are gripping and rewarding, and provides a enough of a
challenge to stimulate a corresponding level of victorious elation upon
bringing down each of the colossi. Interestingly, as the game
progresses, the tone of the animations and solemn music begin to subtly
expose these victories for what they are: the slaughter of a magical,
unique and irreplaceable creature, leaving the world a more forlorn and
empty place. This effectively leverages the player's third-person
complicity in the killings, eventually evoking feelings of guilt for
your premeditated attacks on your ultimately vulnerable victims.
Reflective of your character's determination, heedlessly pursuing an
outcome that is hinted at in his own deteriorating appearance, you have
no choice but to carry on.</p>
<p>Overlaid on this evolving cyclic structure, a delicate narrative is
unobtrusively woven, complete with possibly the most affecting death of
a character in any videogame to date. The story culminates by
exquisitely dovetailing with the opening of the game <em>Ico</em> (PS2, Team
Ico, 2001), making this <em>Ico'</em>s prequel (and finally explaining that
game's protagonist's stigmatic horns.)</p>
<p>I've said it before and I'll say it again. Videogames are a nascent,
immature medium. None amongst us can so much as dream of what they will
one day be capable of. Look upon works such as this as history in the
making, the first time a human has wrought a creative endeavour such as
this, pushing forward the expectations and outlook of the whole
industry, and spellbinding a generation.</p>
<p>Alright, we're done here. You may leave. Time for me to begin my
experiments with a new subjectivity-proof rating system:</p>
<p>Rating: Position yourself appropriately somewhere between:</p>
<p>10/10 if you wish to enjoy the state of the art in what videogames as a
medium are capable of.</p>
<p>0/10 if you are incapable of appreciating beauty or have no soul.</p>

<p><em>by Will McGugan</em></p>
<p>Introduces Python, PyGame and game development ideas from the ground up,
in a really pleasant writing style which is both unintimidating, clear
and covers all the bases. It's definitely a book for beginners though,
walking through high-school topics like bitmaps and vectors and
matrices, but having laid the foundations, it works up to an excellent
hands-on overview of using OpenGL in the final three chapters, including
lighting, textures and fog. It makes all the topics very accessible, and
does an incredible job of putting all the various topics to work
together to form a cohesive and illustrating whole.</p>
<p>Nothing extremely hardcore is covered though. An 'ants chasing spiders'
state machine is probably the most involved example in here, barring the
latter parts of the OpenGL section, with four-state creatures
beautifully explained and presented. If you're already doing OpenGL or
game development, even as a piss-poor amateur like myself, you likely
already know many of the things between these covers, aside from the
PyGame specifics, which are generally transparent enough to figure out
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> In the months since I wrote this review, I've found my
thoughts returning to this book time and again, and have come to the
conclusion that I gained more from its extremely clear exposition than I
realised at the time. I'm revising the review scores significantly
upwards to reflect this.</p>
<p>Rating: 10/10 for beginners. 5/10 for experts. Consider yourself
somewhere between the two.</p>

<p><em>Director: Andrew Stanton</em></p>
<p>I resisted for quite a while, expecting cloying superficiality. I was
wrong. Or at least I <em>like</em> this kind of cloying superficiality. Clearly
made with love by a truly dedicated army of master artisans. Featuring
sound effects from the same guru sound guy who worked on the original
Star Wars, along with an animation team who watched every single Buster
Keaton and Charlie Chaplin movie over their lunchtimes, to inspire them
in the ways of visual story telling. With a hardcore <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Products_(Larry_Niven)#General_Products_Hull">Larry
Niven</a>
reference and a serious environmental message in the background to boot.
Huge fun. I watched it twice.</p>
<p>Rating: 8/10 - Thoroughly engaging, emotive and humorous.</p>
