<p><em>by Ray Bradbury</em>, 1953.</p>
<p>A tale of future urban America, in which political or critical thought
is suppressed by overwhelming popular entertainment and by burning all
books, told with Bradbury's typical simple and beautiful prose. Rarely
has a tale suffused me with such peace and tranquillity than my making
the transition from the frantic, advertising-saturated dystopia into the
moonlit fields and abandoned railroads of the closing chapters.</p>
<p>The novel has a curiously bifurcated message for modern times. We would
seem to be even more overwhelmed by noisy and crass distractions of
types unimaginable in Bradbury's time, often unable to pry ourselves
free from a myriad compelling sources of entertainment.</p>
<p>However, for all the negative impact this internet may have had on our
peace of mind and our attention spans, it has also provided tremendous
benefits that to a great extent defuse the novel's warnings. Books are
now infinitely reproduceable. Dissenting thought or new ideas can easily
be published and read by millions, free from fear of retribution by
employers or governments, those <a href="http://homes.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html">weary giants of flesh and
steel</a>. Writing by
any person in the world is routinely disseminated to and from the
furthest corners of the globe in seconds. Instantly findable. Free from
censorship. Archived forever. Unburnable.</p>
<p>This ease-of-use provides each of us with exactly what we demand of it.
Just as Bradbury foretells, those of a studious mind, those with
legitimate concerns, those with a desire to change the world or make
something more out of life, these people will always gather to talk and
plan and act. Only now, they can do so globally, instantly and
effectively. For each of us, our salvation requires only that we choose
to save ourselves.</p>
<p>Rating:</p>
<p>10/10 if you fancy a bit of charming retro SF with a beautiful turn of
phrase</p>
<p>0/10 if you think worrying about fulfilment in life, political affairs,
or meaning in life is a big waste of time, especially if it's done by
way of science-fiction metaphors and hyperthetical future scenarios.
Let's go shopping!</p>

<p><em>Nintendo, 2008</em></p>
<p>Nintendo spin off a <em>fourteenth</em> iteration of the familiar and
oh-so-beloved franchise. I'd only previously played the
preposterously-sub-titled <em>Ocarina of Time</em> on the N64, of which I
retain fond, sepia-coloured memories.</p>
<p>I found <em>Phantom Hourglass</em> to be engaging, and played it to a
thoroughly jolly completion over the course of a couple of months. The
gameplay and plot are a tad more casual and lightweight than <em>Ocarina</em>,
as befitting play snatched while on-the-go on the handheld platform.</p>
<p>Using the DS stylus to control Link is delightfully transparent and
intuitive. Just as for a mouse, however, expert users will eventually
eschew it for many actions, preferring the speed, precision and
tactility of distinct physical buttons.</p>
<p>On the down side, some of the puzzles are downright contrived. After
introducing a handy little map, on which you can scrawl notes and
reminders for yourself, the game then promptly takes it away again for
<em>exactly</em> the levels on which it would be of most use, proclaiming 'you
can't use the map here, some sort of magic prevents it.' Right. Up
yours.</p>
<p>Equally intrusive, the dialog is entirely Nintendo-esque cutesy Japanese
schmultz, and it would have improved the game no end for it to have been
entirely absent.</p>
<p>Such niggles are few and far between, though. Time for another go of the
newfangled rating system.</p>
<p>Rating: Place yourself somewhere between...</p>
<p>10/10 if you're into a deftly executed handheld riff on the Zelda
series, beautifully integrated with the affordances and sensibilities of
the hosting hardware in that way that only Nintendo can do. Lots to love
here.</p>
<p>0/10 if you're done with revisiting timeworn ideas, even ones as
compelling and charming as this, and yearn for a resurgence in
experimental originality to kick the gaming industry out of one or two
ruts (such as having a blind spot for crappy dialog.)</p>

<p><em>PS2, Team ICO, 2005.</em></p>
<p>As is common for a title released in the autumn years of a console's
lifetime, the programmers at Team ICO have mastered the PS2 hardware,
and wring the utmost from it for this virtuoso performance.</p>
<p>The gameplay consists of nothing more than a series of sixteen boss
fights between your character and a succession of gigantic mythical
creatures, each rising from the landscape upon your approach. Half
stone, half furry flesh, these colossi shake the earth as they walk, and
facing up to them, armed with nothing but a sword and a bow, elicits a
genuine rush of fear, firstly as their size and magnificence become
apparent, then as they stand up, and then, finally, terrifyingly, as
they <em>see you</em>. Like moments from a piercing dream, playing this game is
an experience that will not be forgotten.</p>
<p>It's in this emotive ability that the game's strength lies, and the
initial adrenaline is only the most coarse example of it. Those disposed
to gallop directly in the hinted direction of the the next objective
would be missing out on large parts of what <em>Colossus</em> has to offer, and
would be well advised to ease back, enjoy the view, and take some
pleasure from the journey. For fully half your time will be spent
traversing this epic landscape in search of your next quarry, and the
landscape is fantastic, in every sense. Across open plains, rent by
canyons and gorges spanned by ancient, elegant arches, past thundering
waterfalls, though shafts of sunlight across boulder-strewn forest
floors. Cutting through mighty, vine-covered ruins, now occupied only by
lizards and hawks.</p>
<p>This tranquil exploration is punctuated by the excitement of the
battles, forming a delightful sense of anticipation. The battles
themselves are gripping and rewarding, and provides a enough of a
challenge to stimulate a corresponding level of victorious elation upon
bringing down each of the colossi. Interestingly, as the game
progresses, the tone of the animations and solemn music begin to subtly
expose these victories for what they are: the slaughter of a magical,
unique and irreplaceable creature, leaving the world a more forlorn and
empty place. This effectively leverages the player's third-person
complicity in the killings, eventually evoking feelings of guilt for
your premeditated attacks on your ultimately vulnerable victims.
Reflective of your character's determination, heedlessly pursuing an
outcome that is hinted at in his own deteriorating appearance, you have
no choice but to carry on.</p>
<p>Overlaid on this evolving cyclic structure, a delicate narrative is
unobtrusively woven, complete with possibly the most affecting death of
a character in any videogame to date. The story culminates by
exquisitely dovetailing with the opening of the game <em>Ico</em> (PS2, Team
Ico, 2001), making this <em>Ico'</em>s prequel (and finally explaining that
game's protagonist's stigmatic horns.)</p>
<p>I've said it before and I'll say it again. Videogames are a nascent,
immature medium. None amongst us can so much as dream of what they will
one day be capable of. Look upon works such as this as history in the
making, the first time a human has wrought a creative endeavour such as
this, pushing forward the expectations and outlook of the whole
industry, and spellbinding a generation.</p>
<p>Alright, we're done here. You may leave. Time for me to begin my
experiments with a new subjectivity-proof rating system:</p>
<p>Rating: Position yourself appropriately somewhere between:</p>
<p>10/10 if you wish to enjoy the state of the art in what videogames as a
medium are capable of.</p>
<p>0/10 if you are incapable of appreciating beauty or have no soul.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="files/2009/01/beginning-game-development-with-python-and-pygame.jpg"></p>
<p><em>by Will McGugan</em></p>
<p>Introduces Python, PyGame and game development ideas from the ground up,
in a really pleasant writing style which is both unintimidating, clear
and covers all the bases. It's definitely a book for beginners though,
walking through high-school topics like bitmaps and vectors and
matrices, but having laid the foundations, it works up to an excellent
hands-on overview of using OpenGL in the final three chapters, including
lighting, textures and fog. It makes all the topics very accessible, and
does an incredible job of putting all the various topics to work
together to form a cohesive and illustrating whole.</p>
<p>Nothing extremely hardcore is covered though. An 'ants chasing spiders'
state machine is probably the most involved example in here, barring the
latter parts of the OpenGL section, with four-state creatures
beautifully explained and presented. If you're already doing OpenGL or
game development, even as a piss-poor amateur like myself, you likely
already know many of the things between these covers, aside from the
PyGame specifics, which are generally transparent enough to figure out
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> In the months since I wrote this review, I've found my
thoughts returning to this book time and again, and have come to the
conclusion that I gained more from its extremely clear exposition than I
realised at the time. I'm revising the review scores significantly
upwards to reflect this.</p>
<p>Rating: 10/10 for beginners. 5/10 for experts. Consider yourself
somewhere between the two.</p>

<p><em>Director: Andrew Stanton</em></p>
<p>I resisted for quite a while, expecting cloying superficiality. I was
wrong. Or at least I <em>like</em> this kind of cloying superficiality. Clearly
made with love by a truly dedicated army of master artisans. Featuring
sound effects from the same guru sound guy who worked on the original
Star Wars, along with an animation team who watched every single Buster
Keaton and Charlie Chaplin movie over their lunchtimes, to inspire them
in the ways of visual story telling. With a hardcore <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Products_(Larry_Niven)#General_Products_Hull">Larry
Niven</a>
reference and a serious environmental message in the background to boot.
Huge fun. I watched it twice.</p>
<p>Rating: 8/10 - Thoroughly engaging, emotive and humorous.</p>

<p><em>by Tarek Ziadé</em>, 2008. (<a href="http://www.packtpub.com/expert-python-programming/book">on Packt</a>)</p>
<p><em>Publisher <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/">Packt</a> were nice enough to send me
a copy of this, so I'm completely biased. Fortunately for everyone, I
really liked it. But I have to say that. But I really did!</em></p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>I've been using <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> for a couple of years now,
but only on a <a href="http://resolversystems.com/">single project</a>, so while
there are parts of it that I know very well, there is doubtlessly a lack
of cross-fertilisation in the things I am exposed to. So I was looking
forward to this book.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, for such a straightforward-sounding title, it is not at
all what I expected.</p>
<p>What I expected was analyses and illustrations of using Python's more
powerful features: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language">dynamic
designs</a>;
<a href="http://jjinux.blogspot.com/2005/03/python-create-new-class-on-fly.html">creating classes on the
fly</a>;
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional
programming</a>
styles;
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science)">closures</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaclasses">metaclasses</a>.</p>
<p>Sure enough, there is an early couple of chapters devoted to advanced
language features. First up,
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#iterator-types">iterators</a>,
and <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#generator-expressions">generator
expressions</a>,
and then the <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.6/reference/expressions.html#yield-expressions"><code>.send</code>, <code>.throw</code> and <code>.close</code>
methods</a>
on a
<a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#generators">generator</a>,
which induce the <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-yield-statement"><code>yield</code>
statement</a>
to return values or raise exceptions. This is then used to handily
illustrate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine">coroutines</a> as a
method of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-operative_multitasking#Cooperative_multitasking.2Ftime-sharing">co-operative
multi-tasking</a>
without the calamity involved with getting all
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computer_science)">multi-threaded</a>.
It's exactly the sort of feature I'd pondered writing for myself for a
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/sole-scion/">personal project</a>, oblivious that
the language provides it out of the box.</p>
<p>Other low-level topics covered include the indispensable
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html"><code>itertools</code></a> module,
interesting uses of <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/">function
decorators</a>, best practices
for subclassing built-in types, sensible use of <a href="http://users.rcn.com/python/download/Descriptor.htm">descriptors and
properties</a>,
understanding <a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/">method resolution
order</a> and using
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#super"><code>super</code></a>, the
often-overlooked
<a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#id3"><code>slots</code></a>, and
finally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming">meta-programming</a>
and
<a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/articles/metaclasses.shtml">metaclasses</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this list has only one item of overlap with my
expectations. Tarek has done a good job of choosing important but
sometimes overlooked topics, and while, inevitably, I was very familiar
with some of the things he talked about, other sections were complete
revelations for me.</p>
<p>However, this is only chapters 2 and 3! The rest of the book expands in
scope beyond Python the language, to look at the environments and tools
that make up the Python ecosystem. In a way, this sounded less
intriguing to me than the computer-science oriented exploration of
language features that I had expected. But having finished the book, I
now realise that it was exactly what I needed.</p>
<p>The opening chapter goes through installing Python - a topic which I
didn't think needed discussion. But Tarek goes on to cover using <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW
and MSYS</a> to set up a credible command-line
environment under Windows. I've always used
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> for this in the past, and trying out
MSYS (coupled with the project
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/">Console</a>) is a breath of
fresh air.</p>
<p>This cross-platform development environment is then rounded out a little
by installing and using things like
<a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools">setuptools</a>, and
some thoughtful notes on integrating Python development into editors
like <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> and
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, or an IDE like
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>.</p>
<p>The rest of the book covers some of the major tools in the Python world.</p>
<p>I've never previously been forced to get to grips with
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/distutils.html">Distutils</a>. Applying
lessons from the book to a personal project got me completely up to
speed with using Distutils to create packages, making source and binary
distributions, using
<a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PythonEggs">eggs</a>, and
distributing dependant packages that together make up an application.
The only thing really missing from this is maybe generating stand-alone
executables using <a href="http://www.py2exe.org/">py2exe</a> (for Windows) or
<a href="http://undefined.org/python/py2app.html">py2app</a> (for Macs), although
this idea is mentioned in passing.</p>
<p>The following chapters give competent overviews of a wide variety of
topics:</p>
<p>8. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control">Version control
systems</a>: centralised,
illustrated by <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>, or
distributed like
<a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/Mercurial">Mercurial</a>.
Continuous integration using <a href="http://buildbot.net/trac">Buildbot</a>.
Presumably you will either already know these inside-out or else will
lap them up hungrily.</p>
<p>9. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">Waterfall</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_model">spiral</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_development">iterative</a> project
life cycles. I'm not sure that <em>waterfall</em> is really used by anyone
except in case studies of 'what not to do', and I'm also not sure how
you could be a developer without being aware of this, but maybe that's
precisely the point: You can't be a developer if you don't do this. This
chapter then covers setting up an instance of
<a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> and using it to manage a project's
deliverables, defects, and milestones.</p>
<p>10. Documenting a project using
<a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">ReStructuredText</a> and
<a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/">Sphinx</a>, and including hints on good
technical writing. This caused me to completely revamp the content of my
small personal project's documentation, and as a result it is both much
improved, and shorter to boot. Wins all round.</p>
<p>11. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_driven_development">Test-Driven
Development</a>. This
chapter would be a superb overview of the topic for someone who didn't
know about TDD. Although I use TDD extensively at work, I've never used
<a href="http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/">nose</a>, fearing that
getting to grips with it might be too intrusive or disruptive. In fact,
it is seamless to begin using it in a small way and slowly extend into
its more advanced features as and when you need them.</p>
<p>12. Optimisation : General principles (ie. don't) and profiling
techniques. I had never used the
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/profile.html">cProfile</a> module described
here, having just whipped up homespun profilers on-the-spot whenever I
needed them, and it's a valuable addition to my arsenal.</p>
<p>13. Optimisation : Solutions. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">Big O
notation</a>. Correct use of
different collection types.
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/threading.html">Multi-threading</a>,
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing">multi-processing</a>,
caching. Not much that is tremendously new to me here, but it is
obviously a huge topic to cover in a a single chapter, and it covers the
bases competently.</p>
<p>14. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_patterns">Design Patterns</a>, and
how they apply (or don't) to Python. It has been said that design
patterns, as fundamental and necessary as they are to a software
engineer's mindset, are a symptom a language's lack of
[expressivity]{#query .query}. You shouldn't have to write <a href="http://www.dofactory.com/Patterns/PatternVisitor.aspx#csharp-scroll">huge gobs of
code</a>
to express simple conceptual relationships. Although Tarek never
explicitly says this, to some extent it is born out by this chapter.
Trivial (and
<a href="http://misko.hevery.com/2008/08/17/singletons-are-pathological-liars/">much-maligned</a>)
ideas like the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern"><em>Singleton</em></a>, after a
page or two of alternate implementations, boil down to simply 'use a
module', i.e. zero lines of code. Slightly more complex patterns such as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern"><em>Visitor</em></a>, are only a
few lines. It is still useful to discuss and name patterns, but on the
whole reference implementations are so trivial as to be unnecessary,
except perhaps as the most concise and precise method of illustration.</p>
<p>The book overall, then, is a grab-bag of different topics. Each chapter
could clearly be expanded into one or more whole books. As a result, no
part can be covered in very great depth, but Tarek does an admirable job
of getting the reader up to speed enough in each area that they can be
self-sufficient and direct their own learning from that point.</p>
<p>As as result of the broad scope of the book it serves as a brilliant
annotated laundry list of 'things the Python developer ought to know'.
While there will doubtlessly be some sections that you are already
deeply familiar with, if you have any interest in discovering your own
deficiencies as a Python programmer, I can highly recommend it.</p>
<p>Rating: 7.5/10 - Made concrete improvements to the way I work every day.</p>

<p>I want a Python unittest.assertAlmostEquals that compares numbers to N
significant figures, instead of N decimal places.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="n">test</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertAlmostEquals</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">1e-8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mf">5e-14</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># passes</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Even though these two numbers differ by a factor of 5 million, when
comparing them to seven decimal places (assertAlmostEquals default
behaviour) they are equal.</p>
<p>I've made a first stab this by overriding assertAlmostEquals on a
subclass of TestCase, which retains the behaviour of the original, but
provides an extra keyword parameter <em>sigfig</em>.</p>
<p>The code and a unittest for it are below. One of the tests currently
fails, due to floating-point inaccuracy problems. I'll have to look at
it some more. Isn't this problem already solved somewhere?</p>

<p><em>Editor: Brian Aldiss, 2007</em></p>
<p>A collection of short stories from 1941 to 2006. Most of my favourites
in here are ones I've already read before: Asimov's <em>Nightfall</em>, Bear's
<em>Blood Music</em>, Aldiss' own <em>Poor Little Warrior!</em></p>
<p>Of the ones that are new to me, not many seemed to have much appeal. A
few nicely crafted exceptions are worthy of special mention: Ward
Moore's <em>Lot</em>, a tale of a family 's departure from home in the station
wagon as civilisation ends around them; James Tiptree's <em>And I Awoke and
Found Me Here on the Cold Hill's Side</em>, a tragic and visceral vision of
humanity's emotional and charismatic failings amongst the sleek,
sophisticated races of the galaxy.</p>
<p>Amongst the others, there are instances where the collection's vintage
lets it down, ideas that were once exciting and cutting edge, which have
been dulled by the passage of time and events, to expose the lackluster
writing beneath. Multiple tales of supreme computers achieving godhood,
for better or for worse. Tales of malfunctioning machinery that barely
held my interest.</p>
<p>Imagine, then, my surprise, when the final story of the collection,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Crowley">John Crowley</a>'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Work_of_Time"><em>Great Work
of Time</em></a>, of which I
have never heard until now, turned out to be an absolute triumph. 75
pages of beautifully crafted prose, all by itself it is easily worth the
cost of this collection, and a more than worthy reward for the time and
effort of reading all the other stories in it.</p>
<p>This final story is yet-another-novel-take on time-travel - at once bold
and understated, a nostalgic and wistful story of alternate histories
and the motives of the people charged with affecting the critical
junctures of human civilisation. An exquisitely crafted scene lies
embedded within the story's amber perfection, in which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_rhodes">Cecil
Rhodes</a>' 23 year-old would-be
assassin is recruited for the job by none other than his elderly self,
who persuades with a moving and cathartic retelling of how the events in
question went for him. The reader at this point is already steeped in
the bitter-sweet consequences that the outcome will have for each of
their lives, for the mysterious organisation under who's auspices they
act, for the British Empire's fading hopes of uniting the world under a
single banner versus the looming spectre of future World Wars - it is so
poignant and well constructed and performed that I immediately went back
and read the whole story over again. Absolutely bloody marvellous.</p>
<p>Rating 9/10, if you only read the last story in the book. Diluted
otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> A Great Work of Time is available as a stand-alone 75 page
book on Amazon Kindle for £2.99, and Calibre with the DeDRM plugin will
convert this into an epub which can be read on any device.</p>

<p><em>by Greg Bear, 2008</em></p>
<p>Smashing, but not life changing. Another great ripping yarn. I find
myself with less and less patience for such a thing of late, and I'm not
sure how to tell if that's due to the quality of the works in question,
or due to a change in my own temprament.</p>
<p>I would, in years gone by, have listed Greg Bear as one of my favourite
science-fiction authors, but my rating for this one is slipping
dangerously close to the 'not sure it was worth my time' level. I felt
the same way about <em>The Algebraist</em>, by Ian Banks, who I previously have
also loved to death.</p>
<p>I guess authors have their good and bad seasons just like anyone else.
But I'm tempted to go back and flick through <em>Eon</em> and <em>Eternity</em> again,
to see if they really were as well-crafted as I remember them. Whether I
love or loathe the exercise should decide the issue.</p>
<p>Rating: 6.5/10 Why all the X-point-five scores recently?</p>

<p><em>by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, 1990</em></p>
<p>A quick re-read, inspired by a recent visit to <a href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/">the Science
Museum</a>, where we were enthralled by
our meanderings around various astonishing artifacts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The rickety-looking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_10">Apollo
  10</a> capsule, charred from
  re-entry, having journeyed to within 9 miles of the moon and back
  again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephenson%27s_Rocket">Stevenson's
  Rocket</a>, not, as
  I had previously understood, the first steam-powered railway
  locomotive, just a revolutionary improvement in design, capable of
  the unheard-of speed of 29 miles an hour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watson and Crick's original 6-foot mechano model of the double-helix
  structure of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA">DNA molecule</a> (or
  at least the original bits of it, re-assembled at Kings around
  1990), constructed between LSD fuelled revelry and Sunday
  afternoons' quiet boozing pondering the meaning of life. Not a bad
  lifestyle, it has to be said.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Charles Babbage's Difference Engine number 1, or at least remnants
  of it. This is the arithmetic precursor to his subsequent, and more
  ambitious, analytical engine, the conception of which was a precient
  stroke of genius, the world's first programmable computer. Lacking
  electronics, it was implemented in a purely mechanical manner, a 40
  year labour of which he pursued until his death.</p>

<p>I was surprised to learn that the failing of the device was not, as I
had previously heard, due to the inadequate manufacturing tolerances of
the time. Recent examinations have demonstrated these to be more than
adequate. Instead, the lengthy and costly extensions to the project,
leading to its eventual failure in an ocean of debts and soured
relationships is nowadays blamed on the project suffering from
'inappropriate management'. Interesting to see the nascent software
industry starting out as it was destined to continue.</p>
<p>It was, of course, this last item at the museum which inspired me to
pick up <em>The Difference Engine</em> paperback again, an alternate history
novel in which the authors indulge the fantasy that Babbage's project
had been a success, and the British Empire, in the upheaval of a
steam-powered information processing era, underwent a series of
meritocratous social revolutions, and as a result was better equipped to
continue its expansion across the globe.</p>
<p>Rating 7.5/10 - a splendid ripping yarn.</p>
