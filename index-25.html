<p><em>Windows, 2019</em></p>
<p>This was always going to turn my head, marrying a marvellous geometric engine
to an austere, flat-shaded renderer. Bewildering portals, seamlessly disguised
as humble doorways, are the simplest of its tricks. More pervasive, levels are
wraparound along all three spatial dimensions, as can be seen by the
disorienting arrays of geometry - the current level, infinitely repeated,
offset or re-oriented - marching to the vanishing points, dwindling to infinity
in all directions.</p>
<p>This is no mere trippy backdrop. Gravity can be trivially flipped to lie along
any cardinal axis, and one will routinely step off, into a yawning, infinite
abyss, to fall through the entire level, and beyond, through and amongst the
infinite constellations of geometry, airsteering all the way, to land,
unharmed, anywhere that's exposed to the direction you're falling from. It
becomes a form of teleportation, used to get from A to B almost as frequently
as simply walking around.</p>
<p>This non-Euclidean wrapping is baked deeply into the visuals, the engine, and
the gameplay. But for all that technical mastery, the puzzles themselves aren't
as deep and creative and varied as those in the ostensibly similar, but
less technically accomplished, <em>Antichamber</em>.</p>
<p>Having said that, there's something entirely appropriate in this. The puzzles
end up being as much rituals as a head-scratchers, holy spatial rites one
performs to unleash the deeply evocative visuals towards the end of each level
- a faceted and angular psychedelic, coupled with unnerving reformulations of
reality straight out of Farbrausch's
<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqu_IpkOYBg">Debris</a></em>. By the final level,
this crescendos in scenes reminiscent of <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>, profound in
both the intimacy of my commune with godhood, and in my continued inability to
understand what I had achieved. Created a universe, probably? Yeah, probably.</p>

<img alt="The Glass Bead Game cover" src="files/2021/glass-bead-game-cover.jpg"></span></p>
<p><em>by Hermann Hesse (1943). Translated from German to English with evident
devotion and expertise by Clara Winston &amp; Richard Winston.</em> <img alt="spoilers" src="files/spoilers.svg"></p>
<p>This novel is described by some as the culmination of Hesse's career, for
which he received a Nobel Prize for Literature. Many reviews on
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16634.The_Glass_Bead_Game">Goodreads</a>
cite it as a life-changing novel, or as a singular all-time favorite book.</p>
<p>I must confess with some sadness that I must have entirely missed the point. I
have not enjoyed it <em>at all</em>. The number of books I failed to finish in my
life is surely less than five, and this very nearly became one of them.</p>
<p>The first half describes Knecht's education and career within the rarefied
academic atmosphere of some distant future European state's "pedagogical
province", wherein (exclusively male) scholars devote their time to
mastery of the titular game. This relies upon drawing deep relationships
between all fields of human study, such as music and biology.</p>
<p>Knecht is talented and likeable, and rises effortlessly through the ranks,
without exhibiting any real volition of his own, other than being naturally
predisposed to study, and having an instinct for drawing out the best in
people. He is ultimately assigned to the highest office in the land, without
encountering any substantive antagonist or difficulty along the way.</p>
<p>The mechanics of the game itself, about which all this ostensibly revolves, is
deliberately never explained, other than poetic references to glass beads
being used to exquisitely interrelate insights or concepts from multiple fields
of study.</p>
<p>This first half of the book bored me to absolute tears. If I had to find a
single word to describe Knecht, despite his diligence, it would be "inactive".</p>
<p>At the halfway point through the book, this serenity is interrupted by
Knecht making the controversial decision to quit, not just from his exalted
post, but from the whole system over which it rules. He leaves the insular
academic province entirely, to begin a new life, subject to more real-world
constraints. Just at this very moment, as the narrative becomes interesting,
this section abruptly ends in a very unexpected manner.</p>
<p>Out of the whole book, this moment resonates with me. Knecht has spent a life
devoted to scholarly thought, but after many decades he throws off the
expectations of that life to forge his own path. Mere days after that decision,
a moment of physical exertion proves to be his sudden undoing.</p>
<p>Does this show that Knecht should have more highly valued the protections from
the physical world that his intellectual castle provided? That someone raised
in such a cosseted environment was unsuitable to face the rigors of the real
world? Or should I instead observe that, despite his ostensible success and
satisfaction with life, in waiting so long before daring to strike out on his
own, and then find days later that his time was up, Knecht has in some ways
wasted his life doing something other than what he really wanted to do?</p>
<p>Neither of these seem particularly compelling to me, nor sufficient for
the larger themes that I suspect the book might actually be grappling with.</p>
<p>The second half of the book contains various poems, written by Knecht when he
was younger, containing premonitions of his aspirations and his doubts. It ends
with three short tales, each describing an alternate life that Knecht might
have lived in other times. Apparently early drafts had these tales being
literal other lives Knecht was reincarnated into. But in the published book,
they are presented without context, and I think it is only by consensus
that they are commonly understood to be grouped with the earlier poems as
examples of Knecht's writing - his imagination of other lives he might have
lived.</p>
<p>I did not understand the relevance of these tales to the larger portion of
the book, other than the way they forcefully contrast with it, by immersing
Knecht in emotional and painful tales of life embedded within a wider society,
rather than abstractly observing its achievements from without. As such,
they force him into action, and to me they are more engaging for it.</p>
<p>Wikipedia informs me that each of the four tales of Knecht's life focuses on a
different basic aspect of analytical psychology: thinking (Magister Ludi),
sensation (The Rainmaker), intuition (Indian life) and feeling (The Father
Confessor). Similarly, several of the book's characters who had influence on
Knecht are thinly-veiled references to real world people, some famous such
as Friedrich Nietzsche, others being acquaintances of the author.</p>
<p>All of which seems reasonable, but doesn't really help me understand what I
just read. Perhaps each tale of Knecht, in focussing on one human trait,
is lacking because it undervalues the other three. Perhaps. ¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯</p>

<p>I have a
<a href="https://www.coolermaster.com/catalog/peripheral/keyboards/ck530/">CoolerMaster CK530</a>
mechanical keyboard, which I love. It might have come with a small printed
manual, but if it did, I no longer have it, and I'm failing to find one online.
Here's are some things I've gleaned from experimentation.
If there's a manual I've overlooked, or if you have corrections,

<p>The <a href="https://coolermaster.egnyte.com/dl/8NuIc843wQ/?">Quickstart guide</a>
provides a list of key strokes, but no explanations. I've reproduced
the table here, with tweaks for understandability, and added more descriptions

<h3>Using modes</h3>
<p><code>fn</code> is the "Coolermaster" key, on the bottom row key between right Windows and
right Ctrl.</p>
<p>When holding <code>fn</code>, several keys might light up, depending on the current
mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>ESC/1/2/3/4</code> - one of these keys flashes white to show which profile
  (see <a href="posts/keyboard-coolermaster-ck530s-missing-manual/#profiles">below</a>) is currently in use.</li>
<li>If the current mode allows you to select a color to use, then <code>F2/F3/F4</code>
  will light up to show the currently selected color's levels of
  red/green/blue.</li>
<li>If the current mode allows <em>two</em> colors to be set (foreground &amp; background),
  then one of <code>F6/F7</code> will flash white, to show which is currently affected. (See <a href="posts/keyboard-coolermaster-ck530s-missing-manual/#foreground-and-background-colors">below</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Pressing <code>fn + F5</code> cycles through:</p>

<p>Modes marked "reactive" react to key-presses. Mostly this lights up a pattern
around the pressed key. In the case of "snake", you can play using the arrow
keys.</p>
<p><span id="foreground-and-background-colors"></span></p>
<h3>Foreground &amp; background colors</h3>
<p>Many of the modes have a foreground effect that you can change the color of.
For example, in the <em>all-one-color</em> mode (officially called "static")
you can select the color with which all keys are lit, using <code>fn + F2/F3/F4</code>.</p>
<p>Some of the modes also have a second color, the background, that you can set
separately. You can see if a mode offers this by selecting the mode and holding
<code>fn</code>. If this mode offers two settable colors, then either <code>F6</code> or <code>F7</code> will
flash white, to show you which one you are currently setting.</p>
<p>Press <code>fn + F6/F7</code> to choose foreground or background,
then use <code>fn + F2/F3/F4</code> to set it.</p>
<p><span id="custom-mode"></span></p>
<h3>Custom mode</h3>
<p>Custom (mode #6 above) lets the user assign a different color to each key.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, cycle through modes using <code>fn + F5</code> until you reach custom mode.
   It can be tricky to identify when you've reached it. Use the list of modes
   above to help.</li>
<li>While in custom mode, press <code>fn + F10</code> to edit key colors.</li>
<li>Select a color using <code>fn + F2/F3/F4</code>.</li>
<li>Press all the keys you want lit in the selected color. Pressing the same key
   again turns it unlit.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 3 &amp; 4 for other color/key combinations.</li>
<li>Finally, save to your current profile (see <a href="posts/keyboard-coolermaster-ck530s-missing-manual/#profiles">below</a>) by holding
   <code>fn</code> and pressing your current profile key (whichever of <code>Esc/1/2/3/4</code> is
   flashing white.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Some wrinkles:</p>
<p>I can't manage to set a color for the <code>fn</code> key itself, which always appears
unlit in this mode.</p>
<p>The caps lock key is unlit in this mode, unless caps lock is on.
Similarly, scroll lock seems to always be unlit for me in this mode,
although it is lit in other modes.</p>
<p>When you try to assign a color to whichever one of <code>Esc/1/2/3/4</code> is lit white,
to indicate the active profile, then nothing visible happens, but it is
working. You have to save (step 6 above).
Then you can see whether you successfully assigned the color,
or pressed the key one too many times and left it unlit.</p>
<p>While editing key colors, if you wait, without exit/saving, pressing nothing
for a minute or so, then key color editing times out, cancelling all your
changes since step 2.</p>
<p><span id="profiles"></span></p>
<h3>Profiles</h3>
<p>There are five "profiles", each of which can be used to save the current
state of the keyboard.</p>
<p>The profiles are accessed using <code>fn + 1/2/3/4/Esc</code>. <code>Esc</code> is the "default"
profile. Current keyboard settings (e.g. illumination mode and customized
colors) can be saved to one of the five profiles, and then loaded back later.
Are macros stored in a profile? Don't know.</p>
<p>The current profile is shown when you hold <code>fn</code>, by one of <code>1/2/3/4/Esc</code>
flashing white. While keeping FN pressed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pressing the flashing profile key will save the keyboard state to your
  current profile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pressing any of the other profile keys will LOAD that profile,
  losing the current keyboard state.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, to save changes to an arbitrary profile, you need to select that
profile <em>before</em> making the changes.</p>
<p>When turning the keyboard on (ie. Plugging the USB cable into a computer),
the active profile will be whichever one was last active.</p>

<p><em>by Chris DeLeon (2018)</em></p>
<p>Roman Emperor Marcus Auralias' notes, traditionally titled <em>Meditations</em>,
are a foundational text for practical Stoicism. They comprise a multitude of
observations and recommendations, grouped into sections such as "Keeping
thoughts tranquil", and "Cooperation, collaboration and contribution". They
offer advice for living a contented life, with less regret, sorrow, anger and
fear.</p>
<p>Several translations exist, themselves dated from through the ages. This book
combines them, to synthesize a text which doesn't hew as precisely to the
original as a straight translation might, but is instead intended to have the
most relevance to modern ears.</p>
<p>Confession: It's taken me <em>months</em> to get through it. Partly this is because
I've allowed myself to be distracted by more gaudy and immediate books along
the way. Partly it's because I found the best way to read this was <em>slowly</em>.
Practically every paragraph is worth reflecting upon, to consider how it
applies to my own life, and ponder what practical, specific next steps are
implied.</p>
<p>If I had to criticize, it would only be the superficial wrinkle that there's
a lot of repetition, such as hundreds of suggestions to not fear death.
Apparently the original documents were accumulated over decades of Auralias'
life.</p>
<p>Genuinely life changing.</p>

<h4>The problem</h4>
<p>This year I was diagnosed with achalasia. It's a rare condition in which nerve
damage causes weak and poorly coordinated swallowing in the esophagus,
including a reluctance of the lower esophageal sphincter, leading to the
stomach, to properly relax at the appropriate moment.</p>
<p>This leads to difficulty swallowing, regurgitation, and a column of liquid
sitting in the esophagus, which becomes distended, losing elasticity and tone.
The cause of the nerve damage is unknown, and has probably been accumulating
for decades. It's reasonable to assume this is mixed up in some way with
various ailments of my guts over the years (celiac, eosinophilic esophagitis,
chronic hiccups), but causal relationships are unknown.</p>
<h4>A solution, of sorts</h4>
<p>Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a surgical procedure intended to allow the
esophagus to drain properly, avoiding further distension. Surgery happens
through a tube down the throat, from where they cut into the muscle wall of the
oesophagus, then tunnel down to the outside of the lower esophageal sphincter.
There, they cut some of the muscle, making the sphincter less tightly clenched,
so that food can pass more easily.</p>
<p>For me, my symptoms were a nuisance, but perfectly endurable. The main goal
of the procedure was preventative - reduction in future damage to my esophagus.
Plus, there's an outside chance that maybe eliminating that standing fluid
might improve other matters, such as reducing irritation which maybe causes my
hiccups? Long shot, but worth a try.</p>
<p>There's a lot of information given to the patient through the process, but
these are the things that were still surprises to me.</p>
<h4>Day 0. The procedure.</h4>
<p>I've undergone a lot of regular endoscopic inspections or biopsies. At some
point, in London's splendid Imperial College Hospital, I discovered the cheat
code is to ask to do these unsedated. It's a few minutes of slightly
nightmarish discomfort, to watch a burly gentleman hand-over-hand several feet
of black rubber garden hose directly into your mouth. But the payoffs are that
without any anesthetic, there's no need to fast, the procedure itself is
simpler and safer, and best of all, recovery time is much reduced. Given a
few minutes to compose yourself, you can cycle or drive yourself home right
afterwards, making it a 45 minute appointment, instead of writing off most of
the day.</p>
<p>However, going unsedated for the more substantial POEM obviously isn't an
option. It requires more than the simple sedation I've experienced before,
since apparently there's a phase at the end where they check you're regaining
consciousness and are able to breathe for yourself before they remove the
apparatus that's been breathing for you while you are paralyzed for the
procedure. This is the sort of detail that is kindly elided from the regular
patient briefing, which only came up because we were asking questions.</p>
<p>I only remember coming around sometime after that point, and my first thought,
unplanned, was to test whether I could perform square and cube roots in my
head. Apparently that's my brain's idea of a power-on self test. I could do
small integers, like 27 -&gt; 3, but had the presence of mind enough to see that's
just relying on remembered sequences. I was able to envision the process to do
the calculation for something which isn't a cube, like 28, but I failed to
actually execute any iterations of it.</p>
<p>I said hello to a nurse sat beside me, but resisted the urge to chatter at her
about my mental state. Somehow, even I could see that from her perspective,
that would be like talking to drunk people. So now I'm doing it at you instead.</p>
<p>After a while they rolled me into my own room, and stuck a big pad over my
butt. <em>Foreshadowing!</em> I fuzzily thought. I stayed in hospital overnight, for
tests the next day. Forever grateful for Suze's visits even though I wasn't
the best of company. :-)</p>
<p>My hiccups didn't reappear through the first few hours of my recovery, even
though I spent the time propped upright in bed. This is pretty unusual - they
usually return within seconds of me sitting up. But when they did return, they
were pretty painful. What I call "hiccups" is partly a spasm of the esophagus
itself - precisely where I'd just been cut and then clamped and sutered back
together. So I asked the nurse to dial up the pain meds, at first with breezy
British grit, and then with increasingly wild eyes and white knuckles
as they took a while to figure out a few local administrative issues, like
where the person with the keys to the drugs locker had gone. Rode out the rest
of the day in style.</p>
<h4>Day 1. Restart the line</h4>
<p>I'd brought a bunch of things for my two day hospital stay, books and media and
headphones and my own cozy pajamas to wear while garrulously socializing with
staff and adjacent patients. That was all a total waste of time. I was a write
off the entire time I was there, not able to muster the bandwidth even to watch
TV. I saw a single episode of Schitt's Creek at one point because Suze kindly
propped it up in front of me, but I couldn't manage a 2nd. I just dozed, and
was wheeled to a barium x-ray, to check I wasn't leaking anywhere untoward.</p>
<p>At some point during this day, my digestive tract started up again. It became
apparent that it had just been on strike, inactive, since the surgery. I felt
it ripple distressingly back into action, along with some impressive gurgles.
The big pad they'd stuck on me the day before turned out not to be vital in
this instance, but I can very much understand how it often might be.</p>
<p>The nurse introduced me to a plastic device for measuring and exercising my
ability to inhale deeply, on which I could occasionally surpass the initial
expectation of 1,000 points.</p>
<p>My ambitions for the day were to get out of bed and take a 2 minute walk, and
later in the day to tolerate my first drinks, some water and fruit juices,
sufficiently to get approved to go home. Leaving hospital with some
prescription, gluten free, clear liquid pain killers proved to be an impossible
administrative nightmare. Nobody's fault, the system is broken. The concept of
"insurance" for healthcare is inherently dysfunctional.</p>
<h4>Day 2. Home again</h4>
<p>At home for five days of a clear liquid diet. This means water, strained fruit
juices &amp; drinks without suspensions (i.e. no particles floating in it to make
it opaque), tea or coffee without milk, clear broths. Also, slightly bizarrely,
jello, since it may be eaten while solid, but at room (or body) temperature,
it's a liquid. I demurred on Suze's threat to make jello shots.</p>
<p>Ambitions for today were to rise from the sofa for a shower, and a walk or two
around the inside of the house. Scoring 1,500 points on the breathe-o-meter.
Importantly, I now have it together enough to be able to watch some dumb TV.</p>
<h4>Day 3. Outdoors.</h4>
<p>Ambitions today were to take a walk or two around our yard. Scoring 2,000
points on the breathe-o-meter! Yay, progress. Able to concentrate enough to
read.</p>
<h4>Day 4.</h4>
<p>Ambitions today were to take a couple of walks around the block. Scoring 3,500
points on the breathe-o-meter. I have no idea what my baseline was.</p>
<h4>Day 5.</h4>
<p>First full day and night without any pain killers. Ambitions for today were to
take it easy and not mow the lawn (check!). Might have to get someone in to do
it for us. I'd be writhing in guilt if Suze had to go out and manhandle our
temperamental mower around. 4,500 on the breathe-o-meter.</p>
<h4>Day 6.</h4>
<p>Back to work - from home, at a desk.</p>
<p>Over lunch I visit the hospital for an x-ray and more tests. I was hoping to
graduate to a soft food diet today, but surgeon says that, although he's happy
with my progress, out of an abundance of caution he's going to keep me on clear
liquids until day 9. Then a soft food diet for six weeks. C'est la vie. Back
home to more apple juice. At least I'm still under instructions to take it
easy, so retain my excuse for not mowing the lawn...</p>
