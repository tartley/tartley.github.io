<p>I endlessly misremember when to use '...' in git versus '..'. That ends
today:</p>
<p>To see the commits or diffs introduced by a branch (the filled circles ●):</p>

     |  ○
    +●  |           git diff m...f
      \ ○
       \|
        ○
</code></pre>

<p>To see the commits or diffs between the tip of one branch and another:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>     f              git log m...f
    +●  m           All commits look the same,
     |  ●-          unless you use --left-right, which
    +●  |           shows where each commit comes from.
      \ ●-
       \|           git diff m..f
        ○           '-' commits are shown inverted,
                     i.e. additions as deletions.
</code></pre>

<p>To see the commits from 'f' back to the beginning of time:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>     f
    +●  m           git log f
     |  ○
    +●  |           (diffs back to start of time are just

       \|
       +●
        |
       +●
</code></pre>

<p>Throughout, omitted branchname defaults to current HEAD, i.e, the one of the
above that you almost always want:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>git diff m...f
</code></pre>

<p>is the same as</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>git checkout f
git diff m...

<p>Some thoughts on <a href="https://nylas.com/blog/packaging-deploying-python">Nylas' post "How We Deploy
Code."</a></p>
<p>The goals of making deployment consistent, reliable and fast are very
laudable, and the conclusion involving creating Debian packages is just
great. But in the spirit of geek nitpicking, I can't help but think the
justifications given are misguided, and overlook a simpler solution.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt; pip does not offer a "revert deploy" strategy</strong></p>
<p>Yes it does. Throw away the virtualenv and create a new one using the
requirements.txt from an earlier release. This might be slow, but you
can both speed it up (see below), and you can keep old versioned
virtualenvs around, as a cache of the output of this slow step, so that
reverts (the time when you really want deploys to go quickly) require
only a couple of symlinks.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Oooh, and I just had an idea. You could version virtualenvs
using a hash of the requirements, so that deploys which do not change
dependencies can share the same virtualenv. I've never tried that - it
might work?!?!</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt; Installing dependencies with pip can make deploys painfully
slow</strong></p>
<p>This is true. But it's not the final word on the matter.</p>
<p>Firstly, don't grab the dependencies you're installing from PyPI. Have a
local cache of them. That speeds up the install tremendously, not just
because no download takes place, but also because no trawling of PyPI
and author sites for possible alternate versions takes place. Some
people use a local PyPI instance, but I like simply using a directory
full of packages. Point pip at it using
'<code>pip install --no-index --find-links=packages -r requirements</code>'. The
'packages' directory could be checked into your project's repo, so that
once you've checked a project out, you have everything you need to
deploy to local VMs, even with no network connection at all. I wrote
about this <a href="pip-install-lightspeed-and-bulletproof">a while ago</a>.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt; Building your code separately on each host will cause
consistency issues</strong></p>
<p>So don't install dependencies using source packages, use wheels instead.
Then any slow or unreliable build step is done once, when you create the
packages directory, while deployment is now reliable and requires no
development tools on the production server such as compilers, headers,
etc.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> As a bonus, this will again substantially speed up the
creation of your virtualenv when deploying.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt; Deploys will fail if the PyPI or your git server are down</strong></p>
<p>PyPI outages (or a package author deleting their package, which happens
routinely) are not a problem if you're deploying from a local source of
packages.</p>
<p>I agree that application code deployment shouldn't be done using a 'git
pull'. Accessibility to GitHub shouldn't be a single point of failure,
and the fewer development tools needed on production servers the better.
So export the code from git into a tar file when you cut a release, and
then push it out using scp at deploy time.</p>
<p>Having said all that, there are still advantages to having your whole
app and its dependencies handled by a single mechanism like Debian
packages, rather than more bug-prone ad-hoc scripts and Ansible config.
So I'm not at all against the final conclusions of the Nylas article.
(Hugs to you folks at Nylas!)</p>
<p>Dashed this out in ten minutes between daycare pickup and dinner being
ready. Apologies for the inevitable shoddyness.</p>

<p>I endlessly misremember how to use git rebase. That ends today. Here are
my notes to help me remember.</p>
<p>Rebase is traditionally documented as:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>git rebase <span class="o">[</span>--onto newbase<span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">[</span>upstream <span class="o">[</span>branch<span class="o">]]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This is confusing for several reasons. A slight improvement is to rename
the args:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>git rebase <span class="o">[</span>--onto target<span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">[</span>exclude <span class="o">[</span>include<span class="o">]]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>include</code> is the tip of the branch to be transplanted. If omitted,
    it defaults to the current branch.</li>
<li>
<code>exclude</code> excludes all its ancestors from being transplanted. Hence
    the transplanted branch will have its tip at <code>include</code>, and its base
    at the common ancestor of <code>include</code> and <code>exclude</code>. If <code>--onto</code> isn't
    specified, <code>exclude</code> is also used as the destination for the
    transplant.</li>
<li>
<code>target</code> is the place to transplant the branch to. If not specified,
    it defaults to the value of <code>exclude</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, a simple before and after:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>o---o---o---o---o---o exclude
     \
      1---2---3 current branch
                or include
</code></pre>

<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>git rebase exclude <span class="o">[</span>include<span class="o">]</span>
</code></pre>

<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>                exclude
                v
o---o---o---o---o---1---2---3 current branch
                              or include
</code></pre>

<p>See how the commits to be transplanted start at <code>include</code> and go back to
the common ancestor of that and <code>exclude</code>. Since <code>--onto</code> isn't
specified, <code>exclude</code> is also used as the transplant destination.</p>
<p>Or a more complex one:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code> o---o---o---o---o target
      \
       o---o---o exclude
            \
             1---2 current branch
                   or include
</code></pre>

<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>git rebase --onto target exclude <span class="o">[</span>include<span class="o">]</span>
</code></pre>

<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>                    target
                    v
    o---o---o---o---o---1---2 current branch
         \                    or include
          o---o---o
                  ^
                  exclude
</code></pre>

<p>Again, the commits to be transplanted are defined by <code>include</code> and
<code>exclude</code>, but this time a separate destination is specified using
<code>--onto</code>.</p>

<p><em>by Jim Rossignol</em> (2009)</p>
<p>A gorgeous insider's look at videogaming culture, by an author who,
after an unfulfilling stint as a financial journalist, has built his
life around games.</p>
<p>Broken into sections corresponding with the author's experiences in
London, Seoul and Reykjavik, it's thoughtful and manages to sidestep the
patronising oversimplifications of mainstream media's gaming coverage.</p>
<p>From <em>Tetris</em> and <em>Elite</em> to <em>Okami</em> and <em>Shadow of the Collossus</em>,
stopping along the way to examine the modding and indie scenes, the
massively multiplayer intricacies of <em>EVE Online</em>, and the insane
heights of Korean real-time strategy matches. He knows the best <em>Prince
of</em> <em>Persia</em> was <em>Sands of Time</em>, by a country mile. He's one of us. I
felt welcomed to his world. Join us - we'll be on the sofa.</p>
<p>Rating:</p>
<p>10/10 if you understand that games have the potential to become the
dominant art form of the 21st century.</p>
<p>0/10 if it's just for kids, innit?</p>

<p><em>by Ivar Jacobsen</em> (1992, 4th revision)</p>
<p>You might wonder if there's anything left to say about
object-orientation that hasn't already been discussed to death. I was
led to this 1992 book by Uncle Bob's talk "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkDN78P884">Architecture: The Lost
Years</a>." In it Bob posits
that in the 1990s, just as people like Ivar were completing their
20-year journey of figuring out some fairly optimal ways to do
object-orientation, along came the disruptive influence of the web,
which turned everyone's priorities, methodologies and designs upside
down. In the resulting stampede, some highly practical ideas have been
lost, both in terms of design and process. This has substantially
watered down OO's ability to deliver on its promises of reuse and
maintainability. It has stranded a whole generation of applications with
distorted architectures, inside-out designs, and less maintainable code.</p>
<p>Aspects of these historical approaches do survive, such as the
prominence Agile gives to use-cases as a way to concretely tie together
requirements, design, testing, and acceptance. But some equally powerful
ideas, such as appropriate ways to manage dependencies within an
application, have seen relatively little use, and are only now being
rediscovered in guises such as the clean and hexagonal architectures.</p>
<p>Ivar's book can certainly lay claim to being one of the earliest
published sources to lay out these ideas, and he does so with a style
that is convincingly thoughtful. This is the work of an intelligent man,
honed and refined over many years of practice. The omission of modern
testing techniques are the only thing that substantially dates the
content. Otherwise I found it exciting, insightful and revolutionary. It
seems naive to claim that this book describes the One True Architecture
which is applicable to all systems. But it certainly seems very widely
applicable, and has deeply affected my thinking on all projects larger
than a couple of weeks' work.</p>
<p>The book also discusses software development methodology in an
intriguingly meta way, constructing an object-oriented model of the
process itself. Each software development team or organisation
represents a particular implementation of this model. Parallels with the
execution of software are drawn, with the output of one part of the
process, e.g. design work, having to produce results that conform to the
expectations of the downstream process, such as implementation. In this
way, sections of the process can be removed and replaced by compatible
alternatives, to better suit the application domain and the organisation
within which the project is embedded. These ideas seem less immediately
applicable and actionable. Maybe that's just my personal circumstance.
Perhaps they are more applicable to larger projects, which I avoid these
days.</p>
<p>Rating:</p>

and case studies.</p>

<p><em>by Eric Evans (2004)</em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215">on Amazon</a></p>
<p>It's a big, dense book -- possibly the most important of the technical
books I've read in a flurry over the last few months, catching up after
recovering a modicum of sanity in our lives after our kid's first year.
I finish it feeling changed, invigorated, and given new direction.</p>
<p>At its core is a simple idea, which sounds neither new nor revolutionary
on the surface. Software projects, Evans maintains, should work closely
with business experts to create and maintain a domain model. The model
might be expressed as a class diagram of core business concerns, and
should also correspond directly to a body of code modelling these
business entities. This forms a set of core business entities which are
clearly analogous to things like the core enterprise entities of the
hexagonal or clean architectures.</p>
<p>However it's created, the terminology and notation used in the class
diagram (or it's equivalent) should be well understood by individuals on
both side of the tech/business divide. In the past I think I've made the
mistake of believing that only developers needed to understand it, and
therefore the model only needed to be expressed in code.</p>
<p>This model should be displayed prominently, referred to continually, and
in a healthy project should very directly correspond to the specialised
language that evolves within the organisation. Where the team's language
doesn't match the model - for example, your business experts' use of
plurals betrays that the cardinality of relationships are modelled
wrongly, then the model - and the underlying code - should be
aggressively refactored to match reality.</p>
<p>Evans makes a persuasive case that the appropriate management of this
complexity at the heart of your software will be a major influence on
the success of the project. To be fair, this is a viewpoint that I
already believed in, so I was a sucker for all of this. Without an
appropriate approach to these central design concerns, over time
developers will find they are no longer able to understand the code
thoroughly enough to be able to modify or extend it easily, unless they
deliberately or inadvertently use design-breaking hacks like redundancy
or mislocated chunks of code. This forms a vicious cycle of technical
debt accrual, and creates an upper limit on the size or complexity which
can be achieved by any project before productivity begins to slump.
Other metrics like reliability then also suffer.</p>
<p>To counter this, conquering these central design issues requires a
pro-active and multi-pronged effort. Firstly, the existing design must
be understood by all parties. In order for this to remain true, the
design needs to be kept up to date and be easily understood by new team
members. The code must be kept directly in sync with the model, and kept
understandable - inappropriate dependencies must be ruthlessly pruned.
Simultaneously, the "correct" design must be discovered iteratively,
throughout the life of the project, and this can only be done by
encouraging continual conversations between developers and business
folks to discuss the potential inadequacies of the current design and
possible alternatives.</p>
<p>When managed correctly, this lends an agility and suppleness to project.
Developers find it easy to integrate subsequent parts of code because
they 'fit naturally' into the existing design, and when the design is
found wanting, it's relatively easy to modify it to incorporate new
concerns.</p>
<p>There are times when I've struggled to convey the message about how the
resulting trade off works between time spent refactoring versus time
saved over the long term. Evans describes this in an interesting way.
Instead of trying to model team productivity by applying a multiplier to
describe drag caused by technical debt, he simply contrasts the normal
way projects slow down as they become larger and more complex, with a
project that instead <em>speeds up</em> over time, as developers, unhindered by
a cycle of technical debt, are instead empowered by the creation of
powerful and expressive abstractions, which can then be relatively
easily reconfigured into unanticipated configurations.</p>
<p>To counter-balance this idealistic hand-waving, the next section dives
right into some specific design practices which embody these ideas.
These are valuable and insightful, stock-in-trade, such as
distinguishing between entity and value types. But many of the ideas
were completely new to me, such as the concept of <em>aggregates</em>, which
define subsets of the domain model which are always atomically retrieved
from (or updated in) a data store.</p>
<p>In short, I really loved this book. It stretched and inspired me. It's
in a very small set of books I've flagged to re-read in a couple of
years. It's top of my list for 'books to bring in and talk about at
work'.</p>
<p>Rating:</p>
<p>10/10 if you're a programmer, or work with programmers.</p>
<p>0/10 if you're not, or don't.</p>

<p><em>by David Foster Wallace (1999)</em></p>
<p>A collection of creative essays, varying from playful to unflinchingly
uncomfortable, shot through with Wallace's typical humour and
introspection.</p>
<p>I've tended to love and hate his <a href="infinite-jest">other</a>
<a href="everything-and-more">writing</a> in equal measure, but with such
ferocity that I unreservedly place him amongst my very favourite
authors. There wasn't even much for me to hate in this one, relatively
lacking as it is in labyrinthine footnotes.</p>
<p>A couple of the essays left me cold (<em>Tri-Stan: I Sold Sissee Nar to
Ecko</em> springs to mind), but most of them I found thoroughly engaging and
thought provoking. I'm tempted to read up on those that seemed most
challenging to me (<em>Church Not Made With Hands</em>, say), and give them
another try.</p>
<p>It's been a while. Rating:</p>
<p>0/10 if you don't want to delve deeply into sometimes uncomfortable
subjects, such as depression, unconventional sex acts, and rape.</p>
<p>10/10 if you like to be stretched, or at least stirred around, in
interesting directions.</p>
