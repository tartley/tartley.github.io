<p>There was <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=110636457130">a
rumour</a> that
Facebook was allowing third-party advertisers to use user's photos in
promotional materials. I imagine a photo of me and my friends enjoying
Bacardi responsibly being scraped for use in an advert.</p>
<p>It turns out that rumour is false. But it's not totally groundless -
it's based on the fact that some third-party Facebook applications were
behaving in this way. Facebook put a stop to it, and are to be commended
for that. In the general case, though, it's entirely believable that
this sort of thing may still happen, on Facebook or elsewhere, and it's
fascinating for me to think about why I personally have an objection to
it.</p>
<p>I mean, if some company does use your photo in their promotions, then of
course some people would feel this is a privacy issue simply because
they are shy about having their personal photos widely disseminated
outside their immediate social circle - pasted up on billboards or
whatever - and they have a negative emotional reaction to that, and
that's understandable.</p>
<p>Many people, however, would instead have a <em>positive</em> emotional
reaction. If my photo of me and friends enjoying Bacardi was chosen to
be used in an ad, it would actually be kinda cool and funny. However, I
*still* would object to them doing it. Even though I'm not losing
anything on this deal, and in fact I'm gaining an amount of amusement
and notoriety, I still don't want Bacardi to reap the benefit. Why is
that?</p>
<p>For me, it's this: Bacardi, who incidentally, have done nothing wrong -
they are my hypothetical example. In fact, let's just call them BigCorp
instead. BigCorp expect to be able to use my photo, without
reciprocating in kind. If I had tried to use BigCorp's images or music
or logo, for my own purposes, and it had come to their attention, then
they would have sued me into the ground.</p>
<p>It may be that they had little choice in the matter. That they were
merely acting in a way that they perceived the prevailing legal and
commercial environment obliged them to do. Regardless, the upshot from
my perspective is that they would have sued me into the ground.</p>
<p>And that isn't cool. There is a groundswell of resentment in me for the
way our cultural heritage - all the music and t.v. and movies and images
and adverts and logos that surround us, the things that have come to
form our whole cultural milieu, have been prised from our fingers, by
gradually increasing legal boundaries, such that none of us as
individuals, owns it any more.</p>
<p>Copyright used to be of limited scope. It was designed to prevent the
wholesale appropriation of creative works such as books, which were
being copied and republished and sold by third parties unconnected with
the author. This is a fairly obnoxious behaviour, and one I'm prepared
to condemn, and I accept that introducing copyright to prevent it seems
like a good idea.</p>
<p>However, since the 1970's the scope of what copyright is applicable to
has expanded and expanded, way beyond its original remit. Instead of
being triggered by the commercial activity of a large book
(re)publishing entity, it is now triggered and invoked by the tiniest of
non-commercial personal behaviours, not just publishing books, but
giving a song to a friend, or drawing a comic for your blog in your
bedroom that incorporates the distinctive likeness of a character you
like.</p>
<p>Things that used to be common and socially acceptable (eg. giving an
album you like to a friend) are now clearly illegal and can get you sued
for your life savings plus draconian life-changing conditions. We can no
longer give the songs we like to our friends. We can't post parts of our
culture on YouTube. We can't put it on our blogs, or use it in any way
we feel like. We have been unwillingly converted into pure consumers of
culture, instead of participants. We have been robbed of something we
used to have.</p>
<p>I strongly agree with Banksy, who feels that if any corporate image or
logo or advert is shoved into my face in a public space (e.g.
billboards, but also tv or on the web), then it is, from that moment on,
mine to do with as I wish. If I wish to appropriate the image, or
augment it with daubings of my own, then why should anyone have the
right to stop me? (*huge separate discussion reqd here to justify this,
obviously. Maybe later.)</p>
<p>But this, obviously, has been utterly repudiated by the copyright
industry, acting in concert with BigCorp lobbyists, has used legal
strong-arm tactics to deny me the ability to so much as sing happy
birthday in my own restaurant without paying royalties, never mind
ripping off BigCorp advertising materials to form my own pastiche. I
resent that. I've been putting up with it for years, and in return
BigCorp has earned my ill-will on this topic.</p>
<p>So in answer to the question "Can Facebook's partners use your photos
for promotional purposes? It'll be funny and cool!" I have to reply "No
you can't. I agree that it would be kinda funny and cool, but on this
topic you have seriously annoyed me. We are not friends. You cannot use
my photos. Now piss off."</p>

<p>I just bought a <a href="http://www.dabs.com/products/netgear-readynas-duo--2-bay----no-drives-included-5063.html">NetGear ReadyNas
Duo</a>
to connect hard drives to my home network, to stream movies and the like
to our fabulous Xbox Classic media center. In the process of
researching, I was wondering whether the kind of hard drive connection
matters. I mean, if you plug USB hard drives into a device like that,
does it run fast enough to stream one or more movies simultaneously? How
many simultaneous movies or audio streams would your average home
ethernet carry? My first stab at answering these questions are below.</p>
<p>On the left are various network and hard drive connection technologies.
On the right are various uses to which I might want to put them. You
can't use a slower connection (eg. bluetooth) to drive a faster usage
(eg. blu-ray quality movies). Centre column is the data rate in megabits
per second (Mb/s):</p>

<p>I'm assuming that I don't have gigabit ethernet, because I've never paid
it any attention in the past. Judging from the above, my 100BaseT should
be more than adequate, but will be the weakest link. So that'll be the
first thing I look at if streaming seems sub-par. Coolio!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Everything works swimmingly. I've had no problem with
streaming speeds. Problems *have* occurred with some .avi files which
appeared to have invalid interleave cross-stream differential parity (or
something) and efforts to reverse their polarity were to no avail
(transcoding software generally wouldn't even read the files!) A quick
visit or two to MiniNova fixed all that.</p>

<p>I've recently had the pleasure of providing some assistance to my lovely
wife through her first serious Python coding, and one of many things she
expressed surprise at was the lack of a '<em>switch</em>' statement. At the
time, I advised her that such a statement is superfluous, and that she
should simply use an <em>if...elif...else</em> instead. I then forgot all about
it.</p>
<p>Until today, when I found myself refactoring a Pythonic kind of <em>switch</em>
into my own code.</p>
<p>I started with this ugly little lump:</p>

<p>This is from the guts of an SVG parsing module I was hacking up, but
what it actually does isn't important. Its only salient feature for
today is that it consists of a big switch-like <em>if...elif...else</em>
statement. I was going to be adding plenty more cases to this logic, and
it was sure going to get ugly. How can we make it better?</p>
<p>First, I extract the logic from each branch of the <em>if</em> into functions.
In this case, I chose to make them methods of the current class.
Standalone functions (outside the class, without a '<em>self</em>' parameter)
would also work, if they didn't need access to shared state.</p>

</code></pre>


<p>Again, don't worry too much about what these functions actually do. Just
note that I've pulled the logic out of each branch of the
<em>if...elif...else</em> statement into separate handler functions.</p>
<p>Second, I define a dictionary which maps action characters to one of the
new handler functions:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">convert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">lookup</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="s1">'M'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">onMove</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s1">'L'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">onLine</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s1">'Z'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">onClose</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s1">'z'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">onClose</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Notice how the methods are bound to self, so they operate on the current
object as you would expect. If you used stand-alone functions instead,
they would not need any '<em>self</em>.' qualifier here.</p>
<p>Third, use the dictionary to lookup the function we want to call, and
then call the returned function:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="n">handler</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">lookup</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">action</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">handler</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>


<p>These two lines can be tidily combined into one:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="n">loopup</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">action</span><span class="p">](</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Note that this is pleasantly succinct, but still very explicit about
what's going on. We're looking up a value in a dictionary, using the
<strong>d[key]</strong> syntax. The returned value is a function, and we are
calling it, passing 'params', using the <strong>f()</strong> syntax.</p>
<p>Python tries very hard to always clearly expose the details of what is
happening to the reader like this. Nothing magically happens behind the
scenes. And yet, by the good judgement of Guido and the healthy process
that surrounds the language's evolving design, the code remains concise,
without becoming verbose or cluttered with obfuscating punctuation.</p>
<p>We haven't yet handled the final '<em>else</em>' clause from the original code.
It can't simply become another entry in our lookup dictionary, since
it's unclear what key (left-hand value) would go into the lookup to
correspond to this case. We're really talking about the case when the
'action' character can't be found in the lookup dictionary at all. The
most explicit and readable way to handle this case is to modify the
above line of code:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">action</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">lookup</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">lookup</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">action</span><span class="p">](</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">onBadCommand</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">action</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Saving these changes, running the tests shows it behaves identically to
the original version. (Hint: Tests don't make code harder to change.
Quite the opposite - tests <em>enable</em> more frequent and more intrusive
change, by giving you the freedom to dabble with refactoring while
remaining dead certain you aren't introducing new bugs.)</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the final code all together:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">convert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">params</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">lookup</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="s1">'M'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">onMove</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s1">'L'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">onLine</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s1">'Z'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">onClose</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s1">'z'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">onClose</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="n">action</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">params</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">action</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">lookup</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">lookup</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">action</span><span class="p">](</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">onBadCommand</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">action</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Including the new handler functions, this is considerably longer than
the original version (19 vs 32 lines). However, it qualifies as
preferable and 'more Pythonic' for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's much clearer in intent. Greater readability is introduced by
    separating out the code which chooses what to do (the lookup dict)
    from the actual doing (the new handler functions.) The naming of the
    new handler functions brings enormous clarity at a stroke. Of
    course, this could also be done with a switch statement, and
    frequently should be.</li>
<li>It's easily extendible. The if..elif...else construct of the first
    version would soon have bloated to over a screen-full of garbled
    code when we added a few more cases. The new version could add 100
    or so new cases without really becoming much less comprehensible.</li>
<li>It's data-driven. The lookup structure could be generated by other
    means than simply hard-coding it locally like this. We could merge
    several dictionaries depending on context, or create it on the fly
    from application configuration.</li>
</ol>
<p>This isn't very Earth shattering, and of course the idea that I should
be preferring polymorphism over switch-statements tickling the back of
my mind, but hopefully someone finds it useful.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Wow! What a flurry of completely brilliant comments - every
single one contains something of real merit. I feel compelled to rummage
through for a sort-of best of breed conclusion based on all of them...</p>

<p>I marginally prefer the first version - the second alternative is a
smidgeon too compact for my taste. I respect the idea to use exceptions,
that makes a lot of sense too. Thanks for all the great ideas, everyone.</p>

<p><em>by Michael Foord and Christian Muirhead</em></p>
<p>Disclaimer: I'm friends with both the authors and was sent a freebie
review copy by the publisher, so I'm bound to be breathlessly gushing in
this review. Fortunately, that's easy to do, because the book really is
great. (Except for Christian's chapters... <em>Joke!</em>)</p>
<p>Having spent some years working with .NET, and with a series of
intriguing personal experiments in Python under my belt, I originally
approached IronPython some years ago with a modicum of trepidation. I
feared that the weld between the two would be intrusively visible,
forming distracting differences from regular Python. I feared for the
execution environment, the data types, and perhaps even the syntax
itself.</p>
<p>Experience with IronPython showed these worries were needless. I have
found IronPython to be a remarkably pleasant marriage - the same elegant
language we know and love, given first-class status in the .NET runtime.
Gifted with seamless interoperability with other .NET languages, the
dowry from such an alliance turns out to be all the .NET libraries in
the world, including the substantial and highly capable .NET standard
libraries themselves.</p>
<p>IronPython is, to some extent, a niche implementation of a niche
language. However, its position seems to potentially be one of
importance and strength. Not only does it allow Python programmers to
use .NET libraries - and does so admirably, but it also allows the
existing legions of .NET programmers to be introduced to the joys of
Python. They will fall in love with it, and will be able to introduce it
into their workplaces in a way that is politically acceptable. After
all, it is now simply another .NET language. Since .NET is orders of
magnitude more popular than Python, this could turn out to be an
important source of future Python adoption.</p>
<p>This book is aimed to satisfy programmers coming from both the Python
and the .NET worlds, and in this it seems to succeed. It starts with
quick overviews of concepts from each: 30 pages about Python as a
language, and 17 pages about .NET as an environment (data types, events,
delegates, Windows Forms, etc) - just enough to get everyone up to speed
regardless of background, but without being so verbose as to turn anyone
off with a surfeit of material they are already familiar with. Despite
being brief, these sections are packed with detail and very pragmatic,
focusing on real-world use such as inheriting from existing .NET types,
and solving some common problems like creating Windows Forms
applications from IronPython.</p>
<p>This style of practical and dense informative content is continued
throughout. Straight after the opening sections, we dive right in with
another rapid-fire chapter, demonstrating common IronPython techniques
by writing a non-trivial application. Woven around this ongoing example,
the chapter discusses many immediately important topics, including duck
typing, Python protocols, MVC, using Windows Forms to build a GUI, tab
pages, dialogs, menus, toolbars, images, saving text files, .NET
Streams, text file encodings, Python exceptions and lambda functions.
These diverse topics are covered rapidly but thoroughly, giving the
reader enough information about each to be able to use them together
from IronPython to create a useful project.</p>
<p>Having covered these foundations, the book then moves on to address some
specific areas in more detail. The following chapter headings give you
some idea of the topics which are explored in depth:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>First-class functions in action with XML</em> - demonstrates pragmatic
    use of functions as first-class objects, and higher-order functions
    (functions that take other functions as arguments and return
    modified versions.) and of course decorators. These are shown in
    use, appropriately paired up with the .NET XmlWriter and XmlReader
    classes, demonstrating event driven parsing of XML.</li>
<li>
<em>Properties, dialogs and Visual Studio</em> - Python properties, .NET
    dialogs, and using IronPython in Visual Studio. This sounds like a
    straightforward chapter, but as you might guess, the book gets deep
    into the topics and is jammed full of information. By the end of the
    chapter you'll have added to the example application to create
    document observers, used BinaryFormatter to serialise objects, and
    touched on Python's pickle equivalent.</li>
<li>
<em>Agile Testing: where dynamic typing shines</em> - From the unittest
    module and creating tests, through mock objects, listeners, monkey
    patching, dependency injection and functional testing. This is a
    dense chapter in a dense book, touching along the way on Python
    attribute lookup rules, bound and unbound methods, asynchronous
    execution for functional testing. My only criticism is that it's
    clearly hard for developers to 'get' testing until they have
    hands-on experience of it, so this single-chapter, while very
    thorough in explaining <em>how</em> to test, has an ambitious remit, and
    doesn't have enough space to explain much of <em>why</em> we test. I guess
    this is partially my own bias shining through here - I regard
    testing as quite literally the most important thing to happen in
    computer science since the invention of the compiler, and would
    encourage anyone interested to go and read as much as they can about
    it.</li>
<li>
<em>Metaprogramming, protocols and more</em> - More Python protocols,
    dynamic attribute access, and metaclasses. The sorts of things that
    in a static language would be deep black magic, or else completely
    impossible, but here they are just the <em>right</em> sort of crazy. Read,
    enjoy, and <em>unlearn</em>. We see how to create a profiling decorator,
    that modifies the functions you pass to it, wrapping them in
    stopwatch timing calls. We also learn about some of the more
    advanced integration of IronPython with the .NET CLR, including
    static compilation of IronPython code into assemblies, and one of
    the very few additions to Python syntax that IronPython has been
    obliged to provide - the typing of .NET arrays and generics. You'll
    never need to use generics yourself (in Python, everything is a
    generic), and you'll never want to go back to typed containers if
    you can avoid it. However, you may need to deal with some from an
    existing C# API, and this is how you do it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whew! We're only halfway through! The remaining chapters are equally
detailed, but I'm going to start skimming through them somewhat. They
cover the interactions of IronPython with more advanced .NET topics such
as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and IronPython</em> - WPF is
    the DirectX user interface library that is a successor to Windows
    Forms. This includes XAML, an XML dialect for describing user
    interfaces, decoupling their implementation from application logic.</li>
<li>
<em>Windows System Administration with IronPython</em> - using IronPython
    as a scripting language for sysadmin automation tasks, from the
    simple, such as copying files, to the complex, such as Windows
    Management Instrumentation (WMI), administration of remote machines,
    and a substantial discussion on the uses of PowerShell with
    IronPython.</li>
<li>
<em>IronPython and</em> <em>ASP.NET</em> - building a web-based front end to the
    sample application developed earlier. Reusable controls.</li>
<li>
<em>Databases and Web Services</em> - using ADO.NET to work with databases,
    and using SOAP and REST.</li>
<li>
<em>Silverlight: IronPython in the browser</em> - creating Silverlight
    applications, and accessing the browser DOM from them.</li>
<li>
<em>Extending IronPython with C#/.NET</em> - all about creating C# class
    libraries for use in IronPython, calling unmanaged code from
    IronPython, and creating interfaces on your C# classes to provide
    dynamic, Pythonic behaviour. It also includes dynamic compilation of
    assemblies at runtime, which opens the door to advanced
    code-generation techniques.</li>
<li>
<em>Embedding the IronPython Engine</em> - many developers might want to
    provide IronPython as a scripting language within their own
    application, and this chapter shows you how.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, that's it! There are appendices:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>A whirlwind tour of C#</em> - in case anyone wants more guidance while
    looking at some of the C# code or concepts that are discussed
    throughout the book.</li>
<li>
<em>Python magic methods</em> - a description of <em>all</em> the Python magic
    double-underscore methods, which is a fabulous resource, one which l
    haven't seen collected anywhere else, and have been referring back
    to ever since I read the book.</li>
</ul>
<p>So there you have it. If you haven't inferred already, I learned
absolutely <em>heaps</em> from this book, even though it's about a language and
environment I've been using every day for years. I think I can say
without any equivocation that this is the best IronPython book <em>in the
world</em>. If you're a .NET person who is curious about Python (and believe
me, <a href="http://xkcd.com/353/">you</a>
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">should</a>
<a href="http://www.python.org/about/success/esr/">be</a>), or if you're a Python
person who fancies .NET - maybe for DirectX or Silverlight or any number
of other wonderful things, then you should absolutely go directly to the
<a href="http://www.ironpythoninaction.com/">IronPython in Action book website</a>
right this second and buy it.</p>
<p>What are you still doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Good catch Carl, I forgot the all-important rating!</p>
<p>10/10 if you already use, or are curious about using, IronPython - then
you need this book.</p>
<p>0/10 if dynamic languages make you break out in hives, or if .NET makes
you think of Darth Vader, then you shouldn't touch this book with a
barge pole.</p>

<p>There is a lot of room for miscommunication about estimates, as people
have a startling tendency to think wishfully that the sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I estimate that, if I really understand the problem, it is about 50%
likely that we will be done in five weeks (if no one bothers us during
that time).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>really means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I promise to have it all done five weeks from now.</p>

<p>Are you a <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> geek?</p>
<p>For starters - you should totally be going to
<a href="http://www.europython.eu/">EuroPython</a> at the end of June. Python
conferences like this attract brilliant presentations from some real
community and industry heavyweights. This year we've got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare">Professor Sir
Tony Hoare</a> (that's the creator
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">quicksort</a> to you, amongst a
venerable lifetime's worth of other
things); <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/hugunin/"></a> <a href="http://craphound.com/">Cory
Doctorow</a> (everyone's favourite science-fiction
author, blogger and all-round geek activist), <a href="http://www.mindviewinc.com/Index.php">Bruce
Eckel</a> (author and renowned
technical communicator); plus Dr Sue Black from code-breaking hothouse
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_park">Bletchley Park</a>. The
<a href="http://www.europython.eu/talks/timetable/">veritable horde</a> of over 100
exciting and interesting talks makes up probably the strongest line-up
EuroPython has ever had.</p>
<p>Best of all, Python conferences like this one are organised and run at a
grass-roots level. By enthusiasts, for enthusiasts, making them quite
the most fun, educational and interestingly social conferences I've ever
been to. Personally, I love the resultant absence of overriding
commercial agendas - everything is done purely for the benefit of the
delegates, and is pervaded by the community values that made you love
Python in the first place.</p>
<p>One upside of this is that the conference is cheap - only Â£190 to
attend. Interested enthusiasts can easily pay their own way. As a
result, this is one of the few technical conferences that still has a
robust attendance this year - both of presenters and delegates. Many
others have been decimated or even cancelled altogether.</p>
<p>There is a downside though, and here's the rub:</p>
<p>The good folks organising EuroPython in their spare time are desperately
short of volunteers to be session chairs.</p>
<p>If you're going to EuroPython, you could help out! Yes, YOU! You could
sign up for the sessions you want to watch anyway, so you shouldn't miss
anything. Just imagine the warm and fuzzies! The KUDOS of a roomful of
eyes. The POWER of cutting off over-running speakers in mid-flow*. The
WARMTH of a deftly-cupped microphone.</p>
<p>(*anyone cutting the power on Sir Tony will be duly ejected from the
premises)</p>
<p>Responsibilities are described in loving detail here:
<a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/SessionTeam">http://wiki.europython.eu/SessionTeam</a></p>
<p>Please think about it, and if you fancy it, sign up soon (on the wiki
page above) because we're currently all a-flutter wondering how the heck
we're going to manage this. :-)</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><em>by Randi J. Rost.</em></p>
<p>I've had a passing interest in computer graphics for years, but had
avoided the technology of <em>shaders</em> these last few years, thinking that
they were just another layer of complexity which I didn't need to embark
upon while I was still getting to grips with the standard OpenGL API.</p>
<p>With hindsight, I was wrong. I was recently cajoled into getting on
board after talking to <a href="http://blog.vrplumber.com/">Mike Fletcher</a>
(creator of <a href="http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/">PyOpenGL</a>) after his talk
at PyCon, and now I feel as if I should have read this book years ago.
Shaders solve many of the problems I've been happily messing with for
ages, in ways that are easier to implement, more powerful, and more
performant.</p>
<p>I <a href="opengl-programming-guide-6th-ed">whined about the Red Book</a>, but this
"Orange" OpenGL Shading Language book is brill - just what I needed.
Incisive without being overly terse, practical, and once it got into the
chapters about applications of multidimensional Perlin noise it got me
all hot'n'bothered about computer graphics again. Yay my inner geek!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I started this book fascinated by using vertex shaders to
transform geometry on the fly, with little interest in the superficial
fragment shaders used to decorate the rendered surfaces with pretty
images or lighting effects. Since finishing it, this has reversed: I've
become obsessed with noise and Fourier transforms and all the
paraphernalia of fragment shaders, imagining relatively simple fragment
shader that could, I believe, provide a surface with infinite levels of
detail. I dreamed about my old university 'Signals &amp; Systems' type
lectures. Uncanny.</p>
<p><strong>Update2:</strong> Ohdear. Once I started trying to write anything more than
the most trivial of my own shaders, I ran into an unexpected problem. My
shaders just wouldn't link. I couldn't figure out why. The book was no
help. <em>Google</em> was no help. The error messages <em>certainly</em> weren't any
help (thanks ATI.) Eventually I realised that the 'built-in' noise
functions which are part of the OpenGL shader language are simply not
implemented by the vast majority of graphics card manufacturers - you
have to roll your own. Which is not a major deal-breaker, but what
<em>is</em> disappointing is that the OpenGL Shader Language book makes
absolutely no mention of this in any of the chapters plural in which it
lovingly describes the built-in noise functions, along with their
characteristics and uses. Perhaps I spoke too soon when praising the
book. Maybe it is another case of idealistic OpenGL theory that has
something of a disconnect with real world development. Maybe the book
was written before this situation came to pass - regardless, it's no
bloody use to me.</p>
<p>Rating (oh, how I love my new rating system. Check this one out:)</p>
<p>10/10 if you want to learn <em>the theory of</em> how to use the OpenGL shader
language.</p>
<p>0/10 if you don't.</p>

<p>Against my better
judgement I couldn't help but snag a torrent of this. Sure enough, as
the opening credits kicked in, my housemates assured us it was rubbish.</p>
<p>But then what happened is that I proceeded to love it. Clearly it
polarises. The whole thing is shot in a shaky handicam held by one of
the characters - imagine Blair Witch meets 9/11, only it isn't
terrorists, it's a giant, evil <em>whatthefuckisthat</em> stalking the streets
of NYC. It reminds me of
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390384/"><em>Primer</em></a>, in which the script is
so realistic and lacking in over-ripe gravitas that, unusually, the
actors don't even look like they are acting! What a concept. Well this
is similar - albeit a lot dumber - but the strength is not in the
script, which isn't especially strong, but is in the novel method of
presentation.</p>
<p>There's clearly a limited number of movies that could be made like this,
but for me, it was a welcome respite from the staged set-pieces of
Hollywood's more conventional output. The sense of panic and confusion
was beautifully heightened by the total lack of exposition - viewers
only get to see what this small group of characters get to see, and even
that is in blurry and imperfect fragmetary snatches. The monster, when
it is even visible, is only glimpsed from afar. It was the closest a
movie has ever come to creating the kind of tense, terrifying immersion
that really great computer games can create.</p>
<p>I was amused to note that a bridge they take shelter under at the end
looks exactly like the bridge they took shelter under at the end of The
Day The Earth Stood Still (2008) - do all the bridges in Central Park
look the same, or does this one have some special meaning? Anyhow, the
final scene is saddening and telegraphed quite plainly from the opening
shot (<em>Camera retrieved at incident site US 447. Area formerly known as
"Central Park"</em>) and it makes me weep with relief that a movie could so
willing try and break the mold.</p>
<p>Rating:</p>
<p>0/10 if you're not into monster flicks, or if handycam footage makes you
vomit.</p>
<p>10/10 If you fancy being scared silly by a giant alien monster.</p>

<p>Sometimes when programming I like to leave unit tests running
repeatedly in one window while editing the code and tests in another.
The bash command <code>watch</code> is useful for this, and can highlight the
differences between one invocation and the next in
inverse.</p>
<p>I wanted a version of <code>watch</code> for use on Windows, so I whipped up a
quick Python script,
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/testwatcher/">testwatcher</a>, which produces
output very similar to watch, but is cross-platform, and features not
just inverse text, but <em>yellow</em> inverse text. Woo-hoo!</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>$ python example_test.py

</code></pre>


<p>Incidentally, the above test makes it very clear that Python objects in
successive processes get new addresses on Linux, but interestingly on
Windows the same addresses seems to get re-used for different processes.</p>
<p>I can't help but suspect this is a dumb script to have written - it
should only be a:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code> <span class="k">while</span> <span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">command</span>
</code></pre>


<p>but in order to shoehorn the inverse text and colors in, it's grown to
300 lines - a hideous bloat for a minor superficial thrill. Plus the
Windows version flickers terribly - I'm currently using <code>system('cls')</code>
to clear the screen and then redraw it every second. I'll do some
searching for better ways to do it.</p>
<p>However - I've long wanted a Python interface to perform simple terminal
actions like colors and animation on different platforms (the standard
library 'curses' module that would otherwise do the job is simply not
implemented on Windows.) So maybe it's time I used this script as an
excuse to figure this out. Suggestions welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> This idea may have now reached a viable fruition, documented

<p>The Earth obligingly stood still for us twice this week, on back-to-back
nights. In each, a lone alien man arrives in a spaceship with his giant
robot buddy Gort, to tell humans that they must mend their destructive
ways or be destroyed.</p>
<p>The 1951 version was very Fifties - intrusively hopeless special
effects, and seems to my eyes to be riddled with outlandish social
etiquette and hopelessly naive politics. I suppose in the years
following World War II any platform for preaching pacifism seemed worth
a shot. If only more people considered it worth preaching today. I
completely missed the Christian allegory that permeates the movie until
it was pointed out to me: The alien comes from the heavens, and lives
amongst common people, taking the name 'Carpenter' to blend in. He
preaches peace to humankind, or else warns we will suffer a fiery
apocalypse. He is our intermediary to 'Gort' (in fact the servant of
Gort, in the original script) who later resurrects him from the dead, so
that he may deliver his final message before being taken back up into
the skies. Cute if you're into that, I guess.</p>
<p>Equally predictably, the 2008 version was very Naughties. Intrusively
overblown production values string together a mediochre script. The
pacifism and Christian message of the original has been replaced with a
more timely environmental message - the writers perhaps intuiting that
modern Americans are not so receptive to anti-war talk. Otherwise the
scope and potential of the ideas at play are completely wasted - lost
amidst the creative wasteland of a budget that could no doubt have fed
countries. Once provoked, Gort unleashes self-replicating insectile
microbots, which swarm and consume Philly, spreading fast. At the last
moment, Keanu / Klaatu sees some humans hugging and crying, and has a
big change of heart - the Earth deserves to be spared, after all. What a
crock.</p>
<p>So there you have it. Watch this space for more reviews from me -
wasting nights of my life, so that you don't have to. Final ratings:</p>
<p>10/10 if you are a stump-sucking mealy-mouthed pig-dog with googly eyes.</p>
<p>0/10 if you have any vestigial glimmers of taste or discernment.</p>
