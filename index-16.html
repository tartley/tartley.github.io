    <p>I pretty much abandoned the use of asserts in production code once I was
introduced to test driven development. Amongst their failings, assert
statements are only suited to testing very localised conditions, such as
within a particular function - it's not clear to me how they can be used
to simply verify the behaviour of a number of objects working in concert
with one another.</p>
<p>Some recent papers have touched on this issue. For example '<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=70290">Assessing
the Relationship between Software Assertions and Code
Quality</a>'
by Gunnar Kudrjavets, Nachiappan Nagappan and Thomas Ball of Microsoft:
<em>"We observe from our case study that with an increase in the assertion
density in a file there is a statistically significant decrease in fault
density. Further, the usage of software assertions in these components
found a large percentage of the faults in the bug database."</em></p>
<p>However, both assertion density and low defect rates also correlate with
higher levels of developer experience. So, nothing definitive is proven,
but the study has got me thinking. One of the recurring themes in the
<em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Coders-Work-Reflections-Craft-Programming/dp/1430219483">Coders at
Work</a></em>
book that I enjoyed recently, is that several of the expert
practitioners interviewed in the book mentioned how useful they found
thinking about code in terms of its invariants. The use of assertions
does seem to lend itself to testing invariants like this - some quantity
which can be calculated at the start of a function call, and then
asserted to be unchanged by the end of it.</p>
<p>So can assertions be useful even in code that is well unit-tested? Are
there any rules we can use to choose which things might be more
productively tested using such asserts, rather than in unit tests?</p>
<p>I don't know. This is as far as I've got. Thoughts, speculations and
anecdotes welcome.</p>

<p>This is governed by the PROMPT environment variable. It's the Windows

    <p>I had <a href="posts/2009/9/28/python-deployment-sucks.html">a cry</a> last month about
deploying a Python application to end-users being more fiddly and difficult
than I expected it to be. I'm talking about py2exe, Freeze, and their ilk.</p>
<p>As a quick follow-up, I recently <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/browse_thread/thread/5abb44388a28ce25/8ce490b3587719e4?lnk=gst&amp;q=directory+python+installed&amp;pli=1">posted to

about a spreadsheet I've made, comparing comparing the solutions I've
found thus far:</p>
<p><a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tZ42hjaRunvkObFq0bKxVdg&amp;output=html">http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tZ42hjaRunvkObFq0bKxVdg&amp;output=html</a></p>
<p>Each column represents a method of distributing a Python application to
an end-user without them having to worry about what Python is or whether
they have an appropriate version of it installed. 'Bundle' represents
manually bundling an interpreter with your application. 'Bootstrap'
represents a sort of fanciful vision of manually creating a compiled
installer which downloads and installs an interpreter if required,
before running your Python application on it. The other columns
represent the various splendid projects like py2exe which perform the
bundling process for you.</p>
<p>Each row represents a reason to choose between them. By my criteria,
which are no doubt idiosyncratic, cx_freeze or maybe PyInstaller are
starting to look like good contenders for future projects.</p>
<p>Obviously feedback about any wrong-headedness on my part is appreciated.</p>

    <p>You can switch between different installed versions of Python by simply
prepending to your PATH. However, this goes wrong in some scenarios,
such as when a tool like 'virtualenv' is installed in one Python
version, but not in another. Pretty soon you will be executing your
project with one Python version, but referencing the site-packages of
another. When switching, other versions of Python need to be stripped
from your PATH.</p>
<p>As a solution, I present a new Python module, <em>pychoose</em>. For the moment
this is Windows only:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">&gt;python -V
Python 2.6.4
&gt;easy_install pychoose
...
&gt;pychoose 24
(Py24) &gt;python -V
Python 2.4.4
(Py24) &gt;exit
&gt;python -V
Python 2.6.4
</pre></div>

<p>It prepends to the PATH as above, but it also filters other Python
versions out the PATH. It modifies the PROMPT to show the user they are
operating in a modified environment. It works by spawning a new shell
with the modified environment. To return to your default Python
interpreter, type 'exit'.</p>
<p>PyPI page: <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pychoose">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pychoose</a></p>
<p>Subversion repository:
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/pychoose/">http://code.google.com/p/pychoose</a></p>
<p>Preview the module <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pychoose/source/browse/trunk/pychoose_script.py">source
code</a>.</p>
<p>It seems to work for simple scenarios, but there are a bunch of known
problems with it (see the PyPI page above), which I'd like to fix if
people think this is useful. I just whipped this up and don't really
understand the issues surrounding this. In particular is spawning a new
shell the best way to modify the current console's environment? Is a
less-instrusive alternative to generate .bat file which can be executed
to change the current shell's environment?</p>
<p>Feedback &amp; suggestions very welcome.</p>

    <p>A quick response to to polymath Chris DeLeon's thoughtful post
<a href="http://cdgdl.com/lessons/philosophy.html">exhorting the virtues of
Philosophy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A position of ignorance</strong></p>
<p>Right off the bat I should qualify all this by saying that I don't know
anything about Philosophy. I've never studied it. It seems at times to
be an alien mismatch to the sensibilities of my left-brained mind, and
worse, one that claims to be about logic and reasoning, topics that
ostensibly should be right up my alley. I read Bertrand Russell's
<em>History of Western Philosophy</em> last year, and although that was a
fabulous, educational romp through the field, <a href="posts/history-of-western-philisophy">my complaints about
it</a> still stand. Now I'm reading a second
book, <em>Think : A Compelling Introduction to Philosophy</em> by Simon Blackburn.</p>
<p><strong>The Process</strong></p>
<p>The process of <em>thinking about things</em> is a valuable and worthwhile
endeavour. Some people enjoy it, some people don't. Amongst those who
enjoy it, it becomes an end unto itself, and thought and discussions
typically stray towards the more abstract, the more meta, the more
foundational. Anyone who has gleefully participated in a pub discussion
about religion, death, reality, consciousness, government, or any of a
million other topics has participated in this process. It is joyful,
sometimes enlightening, entertaining, and refines the individual's
ability to meaningfully reason on all kinds of topics, from the abstract
to the prosaic. In this sense, and especially from the perspective of
the individual's active participation in the activity, I'm all in favour
of philosophy. Presumably this is why I have been drawn back to read
this second book.</p>
<p><strong>The Content</strong></p>
<p>If anything, I have had more objections to <em>Think</em> than I had to
Russell's book. At first, I thought that my issue was simply that the
discussed historical philosophers produced curiously shoddy work. Their
premises seem shaky. Their arguments full of holes at best. Their
conclusions entirely suspect. While there are some genuinely insightful
ideas and arguments, they are often mutually contradictory, and the
signal to noise is terrible.</p>
<p>Chris points out the importance of reading a decent translation of the
original sources to gain enough insight to benefit from the arguments,
and in this I defer to his experience. There certainly are some
historical philosophers who seem to make a lot more sense to me than the
others. I had not expected to have to pick and choose based so much upon
my own personal preferences, so in some way my frustration here is
perhaps indicative of an expectation mismatch.</p>
<p>As for <em>Think</em>, as I continue to read, it has slowly dawned on me that
perhaps this impression is actually because the author himself is an
appalling philosopher (sorry Simon!) Every few pages he makes what seems
to me like a terrible logical blunder. If this were correct, that would
presumably make his interpretation of historical philosophers equally
suspect, and perhaps this is why they so often seem simply ludicrous to
me.</p>
<p>I realise it is arrogant and bonkers for me to assume I can outclass the
author, a man apparently of considerable knowledge and experience, at
his own game. But this is how it seems to me, so what am I to make of
that?</p>
<p>It seems to me that there are only three possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Professor Blackburn's thinking is entirely defective. I am sure this
    cannot be the case. He is a professor of his subject, his book,
    while quite understandably not comparable to Russell, has garnered
    great reviews on Amazon and in the press, for whatever that's worth.
    As a layman I shall accord him the deference that is entirely his
    due.</li>
<li>My own thinking is entirely defective. This is, of course, entirely
    possible, however distasteful it may be to me. How would I know? In
    defence of my sanity, I note that I seem to get by, more or less, in
    everyday life. Or at least, I don't seem to be any more confounded
    by the state of the world than the people around me.</li>
<li>Perhaps, then, the problem lies not solely with myself, but is
    shared by us all. Perhaps human reasoning as expressed in the
    English language is generally not sufficiently precise, well-defined
    or powerful to support consistent philosophical arguments of the
    type that are being put forward. More generally, we aren't remotely
    as good at thinking as we think we are. Pretty much I'm saying
    that (1) and (2) are both true, but that both the professor and I
    can derive some comfort from the idea that the same applies to
    pretty much everybody else.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Method</strong></p>
<p>There is, of course, a method for dealing with the unreliability of our
thoughts and perceptions - the scientific method, in its many forms and
manifestations. I have friends who claim that the scientific method came
out of philosophy, and while I have some reservations about the truth of
this in the day-to-day reality of individual practitioners, of course in
an abstract sense I can see that this lineage is real.</p>
<p>Application of the scientific method would be the normal way out of the
morass of imprecise thoughts that, to date, characterise the majority of
philosophy for me. Some aspects of ancient philosophy have proven
tractable in this regard. These are the subjects that have subsequently
calved off from philosophy to form whole new fields and sciences.</p>
<p>Of course, this has the curious effect of diluting the perceived value
of philosophy. As soon as the application of the scientific method lets
thinkers actually gain any traction and start to make real progress on
their topic, we immediately snip that subject off from the realm of
philosophy and give it a different name. Astronomy and cosmology,
biology and psychology, chemistry, physics, and many more. Philosophy
proper, then, consists of the left over bits - the topics upon which the
scientific method has not proven applicable, and hence upon which no
meaningful progress can be made.</p>
<p>Chris, and discussion with friends, has helped me see that in this
dismissal, I was overlooking the value of philosophy as an incubator for
other fields. This is of course critical to the development of human
civilisation, and of interest to historians of the respective fields.</p>
<p><strong>What it isn't</strong></p>
<p>What I'm left with is the impression that my minor experiences of
philosophy would have been much improved if my expectations had been
very different at the outset.</p>
<p>My layman's impression of philosophy from the outside was that it
claimed to be the study of tremendously insightful reasoning done by
some of the most powerful minds in history. This expectation was
naturally bound to lead me to be disappointed when my initial foray led
me to discover that many philosophers, particularly ancient ones,
distorted as they are by translation and interpretation, cultural
mismatch, and lack of my modern knowledge of the world, appear to my
sensibilities to be pretty poor. I hope to improve on this situation by
taking on board Chris' advice about choosing particular philosophers who
resonate for me personally, together with the idea of studying
particular translations of original works, rather than quick summaries.</p>
<p>In addition, I had an expectation that all this intense thought might
lead to some more definitive and objective conclusions. However ancient
philosophers acted without the benefit of the scientific method, and
modern philosophy is pruned of topics to which the scientific method is
applicable. As a result, there is much bad mixed in with the good. Even
the good parts cannot be trusted as a guide to any sorts of truth, since
choosing 'the good parts' seems to be a subjective process.</p>
<p>This seems inevitable, since without the benefit of the scientific
method, there is no utility function to be used as feedback, by which
ideas could be judged and one school of thought meaningfully compared
against another. There can be no definitive winners or losers, and
without competition, ideas cannot improve by evolution. Instead, each
contributor adds their own voice to the mutually contradictory babble,
and it is left to the reader to sift through for the parts of value.</p>
<p>The lack of an objective means to prune the discussion of its less
worthy branches mean that many philosophers are deified, their writings
sacrosanct and studied for generations, even in cases where they were
clearly absolutely wrong. (Plato's thoughts about the shapes of atoms,
for example.) I accept that study of historical and ancient philosophers
is valid for the perspective it gives on the <em>process</em> of philosophy,
and as a study of the <em>history</em> of philosophy itself. However, I am
appalled that so much of their actual, specific writings are studied and
discussed in so much detail, in the same way I would be mortified by the
prospect of scholars spending centuries reviewing the specifics of what
me and my friends said in our philosophical discussions in the pub.
There may be some value in there, but I came to this expecting a précis
of the best minds in the world, not a mishmash of sometimes incoherent
ideas.</p>
<p><strong>The Upshot</strong></p>
<p>I've done a lot of bitching, but don't take it as a wholesale rejection.
In addition to the things I complain about, there are also a bunch of
really great, stimulating ideas. I just didn't expect to have to do so
much searching and interpretation to find them. Rather, interpret the
above as the painful transitions in my understanding of what philosophy
<em>is</em>, which parts of it are likely to be of value to me, and what I
should expect from it. Thanks to Chris for his significant contributions
towards my continuing education on this.</p>

deficiencies, to create something approaching a sane software
development environment on Windows. If you are a *nix or command-line
jockey, this might make your visits to Windows-land more comfortable. If
you're a Visual Studio devotee, this might add some alternative tools to
your repertoire.</p>
<p>My idea is that each post will be small enough that you can implement
the change it suggests <em>immediately</em>, right now, as you're reading it.</p>
<p><strong>The Console</strong></p>
<p>The console, by which I mean the black DOS 'Command Prompt' window, is
the pivot around which the rest of your software development activities
rotate. Or at least it could be, if it was any good. The built-in
Command Prompt, however, is absolute garbage. Replace it with the
poorly-named 'Console' project from SourceForge:</p>
<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/console/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/console/</a></p>
<p>Once installed, you could fiddle around with the settings endlessly, or
just copy my console.xml config to your home directory:</p>
<p><a href="files/2009/10/console.xml"><img alt="console.xml (config for Console)" src="files/2009/10/xml-icon.png">console.xml</a></p>
<p>after which Console should look something like:</p>
<p><img alt="Console: It doesn't look like much" src="files/2009/10/mswindows-command-prompt.png" title="mswindows-command-prompt"></p>
<p>Console provides a few superficial benefits that prove to be
indispensable in everyday use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut and paste is no longer an unimaginable pain in the ass. What a
    concept. My config automatically copies selected text to the
    clipboard, so you don't even need to hit Ctrl-C. Because of this,
    I've reverted the action of Ctrl-C to its more venerable usage of
    'kill the running command'.</li>
<li>Selecting text with the mouse now works sanely, although sadly you
    can't double/triple click to select words or lines.</li>
<li>Multiple tabs. My config defines keys: Ctrl-T (new), Ctrl-W (close),
    and Ctrl-tab (next).</li>
<li>PageUp and PageDown scroll, without needing to move your hand to the
    mouse. My config actually uses Shift-PageUp and Shift-PageDown, so
    that it's like old XTerms that my fingers apparently still remember.</li>
<li>We can choose any font. I like Deja Vu Sans Monospace, no doubt you
    like something totally different.</li>
<li>We can resize the window however we like.</li>
<li>Transparency. I don't like it, some people do. (<strong>Update:</strong>
    Redacted. I've been converted. Now <a href="http://img177.yfrog.com/i/5cy.jpg/">I love
    it</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The old built-in Command-Prompt will still pop up if you double-click a
.bat file - I don't know how to change this magic built-in association.
Otherwise though, you can now just use the new Console for everything
you do.</p>
<p>Alright. We've taken our first step. Next up, we'll see some of the uses
to which we can put our new toy.</p>

<p>Normally - but not always - people want to run a program just after the
install it - you can help then to do this by using an opt-out system
with a checkbox checked by default</p>
<p>To create the checkbox and control whether it is set you must use the
following properties in your <strong>Product</strong> section:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">Id="WIXUI_EXITDIALOGOPTIONALCHECKBOXTEXT"
Value="Launch<span class="w"> </span>the<span class="w"> </span>cool<span class="w"> </span>program"
Id="WIXUI_EXITDIALOGOPTIONALCHECKBOX"
Value="1"
</pre></div>

<p>The value of <code>WIXUI_EXITDIALOGOPTIONALCHECKBOX</code> controls the
checkboxes checkedness.</p>
<p>You then need a custom action to do some launching:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">Id="LaunchApplication"
BinaryKey="WixCA"
DllEntry="WixShellExec"
Impersonate="yes"
</pre></div>

<p>and some UI wiring in the <strong>UI</strong> element under the <strong>Product</strong> element
to get you custom action called.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">Control="Finish"
Event="DoAction"
Value="LaunchApplication"<span class="ni">&amp;gt;</span>WIXUI\_EXITDIALOGOPTIONALCHECKBOX<span class="w"> </span>=<span class="w"> </span>1<span class="w"> </span>and
NOT<span class="w"> </span>Installed

<p>Huzzah - you now may have a working installer.</p>

    <p>I don't want to whinge. But I think it's
healthy to assess something I currently find difficult, that I might
better understand where the deficiencies lie - probably in me - and how they
might be addressed.</p>
<p>Deploying a Python program to fellow programmers is easy - just send
them the script, they can install the interpreter if they haven't
already, and figure it out from there. Use of PyPI helps with this.</p>
<p>But distributing Python as source code is only suitable when
distributing to other programmers. For distributing to end-users, it is
totally inappropriate. They have no idea what Python is nor whether it
is installed, and they should never need to know. While it is arguably
possible to lead a user through the process of installing Python so that
they can run your script, it is an absolutely ghastly, terrifying
experience for them, and they will never willingly use your software
again. They want an icon they can double-click on which just runs,
period. Considering the potential complications such as requiring
side-by-side installations of multiple versions of Python, I don't see
this as a workable solution for any serious software to be used by
non-programmers.</p>
<p>Thus we have the projects to convert Python source into stand-alone
executables. I've used <em>py2exe</em> and <em>bbfreeze</em>, and both do a brilliant
jobs at what they do. But there are problems with the use of such tools.</p>
<p>With a compiled language, you can simply give the binary to someone with
the right operating system, and they can double click it to run it.
Better still, this process of compiling and linking the executable for
an end-user is the <em>exact same process</em> that you perform all the time
for yourself while you are developing the software. There is no
additional overhead required to create an executable for end-users
(presuming the simplest case of end-users on the same operating system
that you are developing on.)</p>
<p>With Python this is not true. The whole 'create a distributable binary'
step is an additional headache over and above whatever effort you've
already gone to to make the program run in your own development
environment. Because of this, in a very pragmatic sense, deployment of
Python programs requires a whole extra set of work that deployment of
compiled programs does not.</p>
<p>Presumably this is true for all interpreted languages. I've never worked
seriously with one before. I should go read about how Ruby and more
venerable languages approach and solve these problems.</p>
<p>This situation would not be quite so bad if there was a clear way to
proceed, but for me, my first few binary distributable projects have
been a real ramshackle hack through the docs of py2exe and the various
projects which compete with it. Lots has to be figured out to choose a
tool, and then to get it working with your project. This has to be done
over for each OS you choose to deploy on. For me, it has been a real
time-sink, and I'm still not really happy with the results.</p>
<p>The resulting executables are bulked out by including the interpreter
with each one. This is not a suitable technique for including a bunch of
lightweight command-line executables to augment your shell -something
which, otherwise, you would think Python should be <em>absolutely ideal</em>
for. I guess in some circumstances you could work around this somewhat
by using an svn-style 'one executable, many commands' interface,
although this isn't always suitable.</p>
<p>I'd prefer it if, instead of bundling an interpreter, py2exe looked to
see if a suitable version of Python was already installed, and if not,
downloaded and installed it side-by-side with any existing installations
and then used it to execute your program.</p>
<p>I can't figure out how to tweak the output from py2exe such that my
executable file isn't buried in a menagerie of various other .dll, .zip
and .exe files. An end-user would have no idea what to click on. I want
to make it easy for my users, by creating an executable by itself, with
a subdirectory of binary dependencies (and a different subdirectory of
data.) I could sidestep this by creating an installer that creates a
shortcut to the relevant executable - but again, that would be yet
another day of needless make-work, which has to be undertaken over again
for each OS you plan to deploy on.</p>
<p>For large projects, these sorts of problems are surmountable - they have
enough man hours to soak it up. But for small projects and one-off
scripts, problems like this burn up a substantial proportion of time.
Writing a hundred-line script to solve your friend's particular problem
and emailing him the binary is awkward to say the least. Entries to the
PyWeek 'game in a week' contest are substantially impacted - producing
those binaries burns up hours and hours, when you have precious few to
spare, and very few of the presumably 'average developers' taking part
managed to create binaries that just worked for everyone.</p>
<p>In Python's favour, many of the wrinkles and complications that arise
during the process are due to cross-platform issues. Getting hold of
binary dependencies for other operating systems, stuff like that. The
only reason this seems harder in Python than it is in other languages,
is that when using other languages you often don't even <em>attempt</em> to
deploy across multiple operating systems. The apparent difficulty of
doing this in Python is in actual fact just an illusion caused by being
able to attempt it in the first place.</p>
<p>Doubtless some of my other perceived problems lie in my own
misunderstandings. Nobody else seems to struggle with this as much as I
do. Comments are welcome.</p>

    <p>There was <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=110636457130">a
rumour</a> that
Facebook was allowing third-party advertisers to use user's photos in
promotional materials. I imagine a photo of me and my friends enjoying
Bacardi responsibly being scraped for use in an advert.</p>
<p>It turns out that rumour is false. But it's not totally groundless -
it's based on the fact that some third-party Facebook applications were
behaving in this way. Facebook put a stop to it, and are to be commended
for that. In the general case, though, it's entirely believable that
this sort of thing may still happen, on Facebook or elsewhere, and it's
fascinating for me to think about why I personally have an objection to
it.</p>
<p>I mean, if some company does use your photo in their promotions, then of
course some people would feel this is a privacy issue simply because
they are shy about having their personal photos widely disseminated
outside their immediate social circle - pasted up on billboards or
whatever - and they have a negative emotional reaction to that, and
that's understandable.</p>
<p>Many people, however, would instead have a <em>positive</em> emotional
reaction. If my photo of me and friends enjoying Bacardi was chosen to
be used in an ad, it would actually be kinda cool and funny. However, I
*still* would object to them doing it. Even though I'm not losing
anything on this deal, and in fact I'm gaining an amount of amusement
and notoriety, I still don't want Bacardi to reap the benefit. Why is
that?</p>
<p>For me, it's this: Bacardi, who incidentally, have done nothing wrong -
they are my hypothetical example. In fact, let's just call them BigCorp
instead. BigCorp expect to be able to use my photo, without
reciprocating in kind. If I had tried to use BigCorp's images or music
or logo, for my own purposes, and it had come to their attention, then
they would have sued me into the ground.</p>
<p>It may be that they had little choice in the matter. That they were
merely acting in a way that they perceived the prevailing legal and
commercial environment obliged them to do. Regardless, the upshot from
my perspective is that they would have sued me into the ground.</p>
<p>And that isn't cool. There is a groundswell of resentment in me for the
way our cultural heritage - all the music and t.v. and movies and images
and adverts and logos that surround us, the things that have come to
form our whole cultural milieu, have been prised from our fingers, by
gradually increasing legal boundaries, such that none of us as
individuals, owns it any more.</p>
<p>Copyright used to be of limited scope. It was designed to prevent the
wholesale appropriation of creative works such as books, which were
being copied and republished and sold by third parties unconnected with
the author. This is a fairly obnoxious behaviour, and one I'm prepared
to condemn, and I accept that introducing copyright to prevent it seems
like a good idea.</p>
<p>However, since the 1970's the scope of what copyright is applicable to
has expanded and expanded, way beyond its original remit. Instead of
being triggered by the commercial activity of a large book
(re)publishing entity, it is now triggered and invoked by the tiniest of
non-commercial personal behaviours, not just publishing books, but
giving a song to a friend, or drawing a comic for your blog in your
bedroom that incorporates the distinctive likeness of a character you
like.</p>
<p>Things that used to be common and socially acceptable (eg. giving an
album you like to a friend) are now clearly illegal and can get you sued
for your life savings plus draconian life-changing conditions. We can no
longer give the songs we like to our friends. We can't post parts of our
culture on YouTube. We can't put it on our blogs, or use it in any way
we feel like. We have been unwillingly converted into pure consumers of
culture, instead of participants. We have been robbed of something we
used to have.</p>
<p>I strongly agree with Banksy, who feels that if any corporate image or
logo or advert is shoved into my face in a public space (e.g.
billboards, but also tv or on the web), then it is, from that moment on,
mine to do with as I wish. If I wish to appropriate the image, or
augment it with daubings of my own, then why should anyone have the
right to stop me? (*huge separate discussion reqd here to justify this,
obviously. Maybe later.)</p>
<p>But this, obviously, has been utterly repudiated by the copyright
industry, acting in concert with BigCorp lobbyists, has used legal
strong-arm tactics to deny me the ability to so much as sing happy
birthday in my own restaurant without paying royalties, never mind
ripping off BigCorp advertising materials to form my own pastiche. I
resent that. I've been putting up with it for years, and in return
BigCorp has earned my ill-will on this topic.</p>
<p>So in answer to the question "Can Facebook's partners use your photos
for promotional purposes? It'll be funny and cool!" I have to reply "No
you can't. I agree that it would be kinda funny and cool, but on this
topic you have seriously annoyed me. We are not friends. You cannot use
my photos. Now piss off."</p>

to connect hard drives to my home network, to stream movies and the like

researching, I was wondering whether the kind of hard drive connection
matters. I mean, if you plug USB hard drives into a device like that,
does it run fast enough to stream one or more movies simultaneously? How
many simultaneous movies or audio streams would your average home
ethernet carry? My first stab at answering these questions are below.</p>

<p>⭐️ = my setup</p>
<p>I'm assuming that I don't have gigabit ethernet, because I've never paid
it any attention in the past. Judging from the above, my 100BaseT should
be more than adequate, but will be the weakest link. So that'll be the
first thing I look at if streaming seems sub-par. Coolio!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Everything works swimmingly. I've had no problem with
streaming speeds. Problems <em>have</em> occurred with some .avi files which
appeared to have invalid interleave cross-stream differential parity (or
something) and efforts to reverse their polarity were to no avail
(transcoding software generally wouldn't even read the files!) A quick
visit or two to MiniNova fixed all that.</p>
