I was intrigued by the idea of drawing something on it. I wondered what the easiest possible picture to draw might be, suitable for an artistic dullard such as myself. Inspired by the masterful watercolors of English painter Richard Thorn, I landed on this. 'tis after all just two shades of blue, one plain, one scattered with wiggles, and tiny scraps of color along the edge between them. How hard could it be?&lt;br/&gt;Lessons learned - I started out with &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; too low a resolution, although perhaps that was a happy accident after all, that I shouldn't inflict too many of my pixels on the world. The horizon is tilted - I should have taken care to get the right from the outset. I drew it all on one layer, and many times throughout wished I had done otherwise. And, most important, I remembered that drawing engenders a ferocious glee, which I resolved to unleash more often.&lt;br/&gt;IbisPaintX on an 8" Android tab &amp; S-pen. 2022 Apr 17</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/galleries/Drawings/sailboats.jpg</link><enclosure url="https://www.tartley.com/galleries/Drawings/sailboats.jpg" length="25187" type="image/jpeg"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="false">galleries/Drawings/sailboats.jpg</guid><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2023 10:44:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Self Portrait 1&lt;br/&gt;Awful, obviously.
