The kiddo was so proud on his first day in the security role, defending my mining operation with this freshly painted purple Keelback, backed up by his ship-launched-fighters. I used this pic as an excuse to learn about IbisPaintX's &quot;layers&quot;. There are 11 here, from the background nebula, to the airbrushed glows over light sources. In particular, the purple paint-job layer is a completely flat color, and a separate &quot;shading&quot; layer adds levels of darkness to each surface. This allows me to change the paint-job color with a single five second swirl of a huge alpha-locked pen across the whole ship.

But choosing to draw it straight-on to the viewer hides much of the interesting geometry that might otherwise be on display. And those bars on the air intakes, well, they just dont work. Maybe they are too spaced apart, or too unevenly drawn, or have too much of a jarring contrast with the style of the rest of the drawing? Or are just too badly drawn. Whatever it is, they don't work. I like the yellow patches though. That's something I ought to try doing more of.
