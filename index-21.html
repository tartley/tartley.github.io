<p>I often gravitate towards solutions using a series of chained
generators, in the style of David Beazley's '<a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/generators-uk/">Generator Tricks for
Systems Programmers</a>.'</p>
<p>This results in the outer level of my code calling one generator after
another, terminating in something that consumes the rows, pulling data
one row at a time through each of the generators:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="n">inputRows</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">read</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">parsedRows</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">parse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">inputRows</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">processedRows</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">process</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">parsedRows</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">outputRows</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">format_</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">processedRows</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">output</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">outputRows</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>


<p>where each called function except the last is actually a generator, e.g:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">parse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rows</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">row</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">rows</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">row</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>


<p>This is great. But my itch is that the top level code above is a bit
wordy, given that what it does is so simple. The reader has to check
each temporary variable quite carefully to be sure it's doing the right
thing.</p>
<p>Fowler's 'Refactoring' describes circumstances when <a href="http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/replaceTempWithQuery.html">it's good to remove
intermediate
variables</a>,
which results in:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="n">output</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">format_</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">process</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">parse</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">read</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>


<p>This is certainly less wordy, and expresses what's happening very
directly, but it annoys some of my colleagues that the called functions
are listed in reverse order from what one might intuitively expect.</p>
<p>I've had this idea in my head to create a decorator for generators which
allows one to chain them in an intuitive order, possibly using some
unconventional notation such as:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="n">read</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">parse</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">process</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">format_</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">output</span>
</code></pre>


<p>where 'parse', et al, are now decorated with '@chainable' or somesuch,
which returns an instance of a class that stores the wrapped generator,
and overrides __or__ to do its magic. Maybe 'read' doesn't need to
be invoked manually there at the start of the chain. I haven't really
thought this through.</p>
<p>Luckily, before embarking on that, I realised today I've been
over-complicating the whole thing. There's no need for decorators, nor
for the cute '|' syntax. I just need a plain old function:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">link</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">source</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">transforms</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">args</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">source</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">transform</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">transforms</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">args</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">transform</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">args</span>
</code></pre>


<p><strong>Update</strong>: This code has been improved thanks to suggestions in the
comments from Daniel Pope (eliminate the 'first' variable) and Xtian
(take an iterable rather than a callable for the source.)</p>
<p>This assumes the first item passed to link is an iterable, and each
subsequent item is a generator that takes the result of the item before.</p>
<p>If the final item in the sequence passed to 'link' is a generator, then
this returns a generator which is the composite of all the ones passed
in:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">item</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">link</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">read</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="n">parse</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">process</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">format_</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="nb">print</span> <span class="n">item</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Or if the final item passed to 'link' is a regular function, which
consumes the preceding generators, then calling 'link' will invoke the
generators, i.e. the following is the same as the above 'for' loop:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="n">link</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">read</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="n">parse</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">process</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">format_</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">output</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>


<p>There's some rough edges, such as determining what to do if different
generators require other args. Presumably 'partial' could help here. But
in general, 'link' only needs to be written once, and I'm liking it.</p>

<p>I saw a post about <a href="http://www.scottisheyes.com/how-to-fix-slow-pip-install">speeding up the Python packaging command "pip
install"</a>, by
specifying more responsive mirrors for querying and downloading
packages. For my situation, a better tactic is this.</p>
<p>Step one: Download all your project's dependencies into a local
'packages' dir, but don't install them yet:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>mkdir packages
pip install --download<span class="o">=</span>packages -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>


<p>Step two, install from the 'packages' dir:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>pip install --no-index --find-links<span class="o">=</span>packages -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>


<p><em>(The above syntax works on pip 1.3, released yesterday. Docs for older
versions of pip claim to support this, but in practice, for pip 1.2,
I've had to use "<code>--find-links=file://$PWD/packages</code>")</em></p>
<p>Step 2 works even if PyPI is unreachable. It works even if some of your
dependencies are self-hosted by the authors, and that website is
unreachable. It works even if the version you have pinned of one of your
dependencies has been deleted by the author (some packages do this
routinely after security updates.) It works even if you have no network
connection at all. In short, it makes creation of your virtualenv
bulletproof.</p>
<p>As a nice side effect, it runs really fast, because it isn't downloading
the packages across the internet, nor is it attempting to scan a remote
index to check for matching or newer versions of each package. This is
much quicker than just using a Pip download cache, especially for large
projects with many dependencies which only change occasionally.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://rangespan.com">Rangespan</a>, we check the 'packages' directory
into source control, so that once you've checked out a project's repo,
you have everything you need to deploy locally and run, even if you have
no network. You might choose to treat 'packages' as ephemeral.</p>
<p>It was pointed out to me recently by
<a href="https://twitter.com/jezdez">@jezdez</a>, Pip maintainer, this usage
pattern has now been <a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/cookbook.html#fast-local-installs">explicitly called out in the
documentation</a>,
which was substantially reorganised and improved with the recent 1.3
release.</p>

<p>The last few weeks I've been thinking about the architectural pattern
known as <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Clean, Onion, Hexagonal, or
Ports'n'Adaptors</a>.
I'm curious if many people are applying it in the Django world.</p>
<p>The premise is for your core application entity classes and business
rules to be plain old objects, with no dependencies. In particular, they
are not dependent on the interfaces between your application and
external systems, such as your persistence mechanism, or your web
framework. Instead, external interface components depend upon your core
business objects. This essentially moves the database from the 'bottom'
layer of the old traditional 'three layer architecture', to form a part
of the topmost layer - a sibling with the 'UI.'</p>
<p>For inbound messages (e.g handling a web request) this is
straightforward - Django calls your view code which calls your business
layer, but keep your business layer separate from your Django code, so
it is stand-alone and unit-testable. For outbound messages, such as then
rendering the web page in response, it's slightly more complicated: Your
business logic must pass the result (typically a pure data structure)
back to your web-aware code, but without your business logic depending
on the web-aware component. This requires an inversion of control.</p>
<p>That way, all your business logic can easily be tested in unit tests,
with no mocking required. You still need some end-to-end tests to verify
integration, but you shouldn't need to involve your UI or database in
testing every detail of your business logic.</p>
<p>Also, you can easily switch out your external system interfaces, such as
persistence, to use another RDBMS, another ORM, a NoSQL store, or an
in-memory version for testing Since the core of your application doesn't
have any dependency on these components, it is oblivious to the
change. The business logic, because it doesn't depend on Django, is no
longer riddled with Django's convenient ORM database access.</p>
<p>Same thing goes for switching out your web framework, or calling the
same logic from web UI or web API calls. And again, for switching out
your UI: add a command line application, or a console UI. The core
application logic is unaffected, and your new interface components
contain only the code that is specific to that interface's concerns.</p>
<p>Another side effect is that your web framework, if you're using one,
becomes a peripheral detail which depends upon your core application,
rather than the other way round. Your Django project would become a
subdirectory of your project, rather than dominating your project
directory structure. Since the business logic formerly contained within
it is now elsewhere (in your core business objects) the Django project
is now very thin. Views, for example, are delegations to single
business-layer functions. The Django project now contains just the
web-oriented aspects of your project, as it should.</p>
<p>These ideas all seem like relatively straightforward software
engineering, and I feel a bit foolish for not having been aware of them
all these years. I console myself that I'm not alone.</p>
<p>UncleBob's Ruby Midwest keynote "<a href="posts/2012/12/4/hexagonal-django/%20http:/www.confreaks.com/videos/759-rubymidwest2011-keynote-architecture-the-lost-years">Architecture - The Lost
Years</a>"
attributes one source of this idea to Ivar Jacobsen's 1994 book <a href="posts/2012/12/4/hexagonal-django/%20http:/www.amazon.co.uk/Object-oriented-Software-Engineering-Approach-Press/dp/0201544350">Object
Oriented Software Engineering : A Use Case Driven
Approach</a>
(2nd-hand hardbacks cheap on Amazon.)</p>
<p>I see a few people applying these ideas to Rails, but are many people
out there doing this in Django? I plan to refactor a small vertical
slice of our monster Django app into this style, to try and prove the
idea for myself.</p>

<p>My passwords and other miscellany are in a plain text file within an
encrypted zip. Since starting to use OSX I've been looking for a way to
access my passwords such that:</p>
<ul>
<li>I get prompted for the decryption password.</li>
<li>The file gets unzipped, but not in the same directory, because
    that's synced to Dropbox, so would send my plaintext passwords to
    them every time I accessed them. Maybe to /tmp?</li>
<li>The plaintext file within the zip is opened in \$EDITOR.</li>
<li>Wait for me to close \$EDITOR, then remove my plaintext passwords
    from the filesystem.</li>
<li>Before deleting the passwords, check if I've updated them. If so,
    put the new updated version back into the original zip file.</li>
<li>Don't forget to keep the updated zip file encrypted, using the same
    password as before, without prompting for it again.</li>
</ul>
<p>I failed to find an existing app which would do all this (although I had
no trouble on Linux or even on Windows.) Hence, resorting to good old

<p>I love the brilliant Vim plugin
<a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2441">pyflakes-vim</a>,
which highlights errors &amp; warnings, and since I got a MacBook for work,
I've been using MacVim a lot.</p>
<p>This combination has a problem, that MacVim uses the OSX system default
Python 2.6, so pyflakes is unable to handle Python 2.7 syntax, such as
set literals. These are marked as a syntax errors, which prevents the
rest of the file from being parsed.</p>
<p>The solution is to compile your own MacVim, using Python 2.7 instead of
the system Python. The following commands got MacVim compiled for me:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="ch">#!/bin/bash</span>
git clone git://github.com/b4winckler/macvim.git
<span class="nb">cd</span> macvim/src
<span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">LDFLAGS</span><span class="o">=</span>-L/usr/lib
./configure <span class="se">\</span>
    --with-features<span class="o">=</span>huge <span class="se">\</span>
    --enable-rubyinterp <span class="se">\</span>
    --enable-perlinterp <span class="se">\</span>
    --enable-cscope <span class="se">\</span>
    --enable-pythoninterp <span class="se">\</span>
    --with-python-config-dir<span class="o">=</span>/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/config
make
open MacVim/build/Release
<span class="nb">echo</span> Drag MacVim.app to your Applications directory
</code></pre>


<p>Without the LDFLAGS setting, I was missing some symbols at link. The
--with-python-config-dir entry came from typing 'which python' to find
where my Python 2.7 install lives, and modifying that result to find its
'config' directory (whatever that is) near to the binary.</p>
<p>As indicated, install by dragging the resulting
macvim/src/MacVim/build/Release/MacVim.app into your Applications
directory.</p>
<p>Open up MacVim, and check out the built-in Python version:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">python</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">version</span>
<span class="mf">2.7</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">r271</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">86882</span><span class="n">M</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Nov</span> <span class="mi">30</span> <span class="mi">2010</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">35</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">34</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>


<p>And files with set literals are now correctly parsed for errors.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> This only works if the Python 2.7 is your default 'python'
executable. Otherwise, or if you get "ImportError: No module named
site"?, see Richard's comments below.</p>

    <div>
<p>I'm finding that our Django project's tests fall into an uncomfortable
middle-ground, halfway between end-to-end acceptance tests and proper
unit tests. As such they don't exhibit the best qualities of either. I'd
like to fix this.</p>
<p>We're testing our Django application in what I believe is the canonical
way, as described by the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/testing/">excellent
documentation</a>.
We have a half-dozen Django applications, with a mixture of
<code>unittest.TestCase</code> and <code>django.test.TestCase</code> subclasses in each
application's tests.py module. They generally use fixtures or the Django
ORM to set up data for the test, then invoke the function-under-test,
and then make assertions about return values or side-effects, often
using the ORM again to assert about the new state of the database.</p>
<h3>Not an Acceptance Test</h3>
<p>Such a test doesn't provide the primary benefit of an acceptance test,
namely proof that the application actually works, because it isn't quite
end-to-end enough. Instead of calling methods-under-test, we should be
using the Django testing client to make HTTP requests to our web
services, and maybe incorporating Selenium tests to drive our web UI.
This change is a lot of work, but at least the path forward seems clear.</p>
<p>However, an additional problem is that acceptance tests ought to be
associated with features that are visible to an end user. A single user
story might involve calls to several views, potentially spread across
different Django apps. Because of this, I don't think it's appropriate
for an acceptance test to live within a single Django app's directory.</p>
<h3>Not a Unit Test</h3>
<p>On the other hand, our existing tests are also not proper unit tests.
They hit the (test) database and the filesystem, and they currently
don't do any mocking out of expensive or complicated function calls. As
a result, they are slow to run, and will only get slower as we ramp up
our feature set and our test coverage. This is a cardinal sin for unit
tests, and it discourages developers from running the tests frequently
enough. In addition, tests like this often require extensive setup of
test data, and are therefore hard to write, so it's very
labour-intensive to provide adequate test coverage.</p>
<h3>My Solution</h3>
<p><strong>1) I've created a top-level acceptancetests directory.</strong> Most of our
current tests will be moved into this directory, because they are closer
to acceptance tests than unit tests, and will gradually be modified to
be more end-to-end.</p>
<p>These acceptance tests need to be run by the Django testrunner, since
they rely on lots of things that it does, such as creating the test
database and rolling back after each test method. However, the Django
testrunner won't find these tests unless I make 'acceptancetests' a new
Django application, and import all acceptance test classes into its
tests.py. I'm considering doing this, but for the moment I have another
solution, which I'll describe in a moment.</p>
<p>We also need to be able to create unit tests for all of our code,
regardless of whether that code is within a Django model, or somewhere
else in a Django app, or in another top-level directory that isn't a
Django app. Such unit tests should live in a 'tests' package right next
to the code they test. I'm puzzled as to why Django's testrunner doesn't
look for unit tests throughout the project and just run them all, along
with the Django-specific tests.</p>
<p><strong>2) My solution to this is to augment the Django test runner</strong>, by
inheriting from it. My test runner, instead of just looking for tests in
each app's models.py and tests.py, looks for subclasses of
unittest.TestCase in every module throughout the whole project. Setting
Django's settings.TEST_RUNNER causes this custom test runner to be used
by 'manage.py test'. Thanks to the Django contributors for this
flexibility!</p>
<p>So the new test runner finds and runs all the tests which the default
Django runner runs, and it also finds our unit tests from all over the
project, and it also includes our new top-level 'acceptancetests'
directory. This is great!</p>
<p>One surprise is that the number of tests which get run has actually
decreased. On closer inspection, this is because the standard Django
test runner includes all the tests for every Django app, and this
includes not just my project's apps, but also the built-in and
middleware Django apps. We are no longer running these tests. Is this
important? I'm not sure: After all, we are not modifying the code in
django.contrib, so I don't expect these tests to start failing. On the
other hand, maybe those tests help to demonstrate that our Django
settings are not broken?</p>
<h3>An appeal for sanity</h3>
<p>My solutions seem to work, but I'm suspicious that I'm swimming against
the current, because I haven't found much discussion about these issues,
so maybe I'm just well off the beaten path. Have many other people
already written a similar extension to Django's test runner? If so,
where are they all? If not, why not? How else is everyone running their
Django project tests in locations other than models.py or tests.py? Or
do they not have tests outside these locations? If not, why not? I'd
love to hear about it if I'm doing it wrong, or if there's an easier
approach.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> My <a href="http://rangespan.com/">fabulous employer</a> has given
permission to release the test runner as open source:</p>

<p>The usual solution to typing non-US characters on a US keyboard in
Windows is to hold left-alt, then type on the numeric keypad:</p>
<p>£   Left-alt + 0163</p>
<p>€   Left-alt + 0128</p>
<p>This is a pain on my (otherwise fabulous) Thinkpad laptop, because the
numeric keypad is accessed by holding the blue 'Fn' key while you tap
ScrLk, to toggle numeric keypad mode, and then doing the same again
afterwards to turn it off.</p>
<p>One inadequate alternative (on WindowsXP, YMMV) is to go into control
panel; Regional and Language Options; Languages; Details; Settings. Add
a new keyboard configuration, "United States-International", which
should be grouped under your existing language ("English (United
Kingdom)" for me.) OK all the dialogs, restart your applications.</p>
<p>Now you can simply type:</p>
<p>£   Right-alt + Shift + 4</p>
<p>€   Right-alt + 5</p>
<p>The downside of this solution is that the "UnitedStates-International"
keyboard setting adds a bunch of other features, including 'dead-keys',
whereby quotes and other punctuation are used to add accents to letters,
which is overly intrusive if, like me, you hardly ever use accents.</p>
<p>Ultimate solution then, define your own personal keyboard layout.
Download the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator from here:
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964665">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964665</a>.</p>
<p>My end result is an MSI with which I can install a new keyboard layout,
which is exactly like 'US', but with the addition of £ on the key
right-alt + 3:</p>

<p>The source .klc file is in there, so you could add your own tweaks on
top of that.</p>
