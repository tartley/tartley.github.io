<p><em>Released on PlayStation 3 by thatgamecompany in 2012. Played on Windows 10 in
2022.</em></p>
<p>The slow-paced opening scenes, alternately trudging up and then surfing down
sunbaked desert dunes, failed to sustain Zander's interest, so I ended up
playing through its short runtime by myself.</p>
<p>In some ways it's an indictment of videogame culture that ten years later it
still feels so fresh and radical to pair players up with another internet
rando, while giving them no means to communicate or interact other than helping
each other out, either leading by example, or exchanging wordless shouts. It
seems like a pretty limited repertoire at first. I'm half tempted to just wander
off ahead, alone, into the endless desert.</p>
<p>Then, you realize that standing close enough together recharges each other's
magical flying scarves. Suddenly, it's enough. You cling to each other for dear
life through the howling storms, double back to rescue each other from prowling
beasts, and then fly exuberantly above the sunlit clouds, forever curving back
to seek each other's life-giving sustenance.</p>
<p>I don't know who the two internet randos were, with whom I shared the first and
second halves of my journey. But in those minutes together, we lived a
lifetime's worth.</p>

<p>There's so much to write about the Expanse. It's such a relief to find a
science fiction show with an ambitiously futuristic setting depicted in a way
that doesn't make scientifically literate people cringe and shout at the
television.</p>
<p>Also, it shines at taking the time for quiet moments of character work, from
Miller's lonely, poignant realization in s01 that he wasn't the talented
office maverick, just incompetent and unreliable, right up to the quiet,
unseen payoff of Naomi's years-long efforts to save her son from his father's
influence, in the final seconds of s06.</p>
<p>On many axes, it's the best SF on television, which is saying something, as
there are so many competitors. Science fiction output is following some sort
of Moore's law of endless expansion, in response to society's need for
mythic stories of relevance to modern life, itself a symptom of the meaning
crisis of modern society. But this is a mixed blessing, because the resulting
shows &amp; movies are often drawn to using the superficial trappings of science
fiction, spaceships and lasers (pew pew!), while failing to fulfil the deeper
psychological needs of mythical or symbolic significance that brought about
their creation. The Expanse is perhaps the prime example of this.</p>
<p><a href="posts/the-expanse/damiengwalter.com">My fantastic SF podcast guy</a> defines SF as the arena in
which we forge new myths of psychological meaning for modern life, which are
sorely needed as traditional myths dwindle in relevance, as they are
predominantly based on nature and superstition. Movements such as spiritual
atheism are a reflection that even the least spiritual amongst us recognize
that something is missing.</p>
<p>I do concede that defining SF in this way is a bit of a cheat. It's somewhat
aggrandizing, claiming any great mythic work as actually being part of the
SF genre, an no doubt is a somewhat defensive reaction to mainstream
dismissal of science fiction as puerile. But it does provide a marvellous
framework for discussion, and adopting this definition makes several
previously puzzling things fall into place.</p>
<p>It settles the revealing, never-ending debates over which works are, and
are not, science fiction. Somewhat tellingly, to me, such debates are
irreconcilable precisely because of the misnomer "science fiction", which was
never really about the science to begin with, as this style of fiction has
existed long before science was the focus. It only gravitated towards using
science as it became apparent that is now where society's power and
transformation springs from - our incarnation of gods and magic - and the name
"science fiction" was then applied post-facto, missing the underlying fact
that this is just mythic fiction with some modern attributes.</p>
<p>This definition perfectly explains things like how the first half of the movie
"Sunshine" could be such astonishing science-fiction, while the second half
- set aboard the exact same spaceship - is just a mediocre slasher flick.</p>
<p>So. SF is the arena within which we construct new mythic narratives.</p>
<p>By this I mean that great science fiction tends to create a story that
resonates because it leans on powerful mythic tropes - symbolic
representations of psychological significance, character arcs mirroring
Jungian archetypes, thematic elements that are told allegorically, suggesting
things to the reader/watcher on a level that can be more powerful than merely
stating them directly to the conscious mind.</p>
<p>In this way, all-time-great examples such as <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> (the
title being conscious of this mythic entanglement) leans heavily into themes
such as humanity watched over by an ancient, mysterious, godlike alien
influence which has literally created humanity in its present form, and
observes as we now reach a second inflection point, materializing not
just a tale of personal transcendence (although it is certainly that), but one
of species-wide sublimation - suggesting that it is time for us all to reach
spiritual adulthood, to graduate to whatever comes next, to meet and be
transformed by the wise and powerful force that has shepherded humanity
through our previous prehistorical transitions.</p>
<p>I could go on with similar examples, but will just briefly mention the original
Matrix movie, which is a story which resonates because it is absolutely soaked
in allegory of both religious transcendence and Jungian archetypes - which are
so on-the-nose that it cannot possibly be accidental, a fact acknowledged
directly by the creators in the sequels, when they depict the Architect,
ultimate villain encountered at the narrative peak of the story, as a prim,
middle aged, white bearded gentleman, wearing an Edwardian suit. He speaks in a
precise, almost Germanic manner. This is, unmistakably, Sigmund Freud. Why is
Freud the villain of the Matrix? Because Freud was a contemporaneous antagonist
to Jung, resisting Jung's ideas of self actualization through reconciliation of
the archetypes, just as the Architect resists Neo's progression along that same
path.</p>
<p>It may be my own lack of imagination, but compared to examples like this, the
Expanse starts to look a bit thin. I don't see any symbolism or allegory.
There is some good character work but no actual arcs of transcendence. Through
the unfortunate realities of converting books to screen, large chunks of what
could have been the most meaningful story were simply abandoned and will
apparently never be finished on the screen. In their stead, what would have
been mythic elements become a series of "McGuffin of the week", as we never
circle back to resolve why the protomolecule was created, why it was sent to
our ancient solar system, why it turns people into nuclear-powered zombies,
and what force destroyed the protomolecule creators, and why? And that's just
series one's unresolved elements.</p>
<p>So, lacking that, what the Expanse has to offer is its superlative
world-building and sane, believable depictions of a gritty interplanetary
future. Which is no small feat - arguably nobody else has done it better. But,
for me, it isn't enough. Maybe that's just because I'm a godless heathen who
looks to get my spiritual fix through TV shows about spaceships. Or maybe it's
because science fiction is where we show ourselves what we're capable of, what
to aim for, and I believe we can aim higher than just exciting technological
dystopias.</p>

<p><em>by Carl Sagan, 1985.</em></p>
<p>I put this into my library queue as it's highly regarded in some parts, and I'd
never read it. But at about chapter 2, I started to realize that I actually
have read it, maybe thirty years ago. Not only that, but I'm pretty sure I
actually have a copy somewhere on the shelves here at home. I'm going senile.</p>
<p>Oh well, at least it's the sort of senile that gives me quick, pleasant things
to read.</p>
<hr>
<p>Also this month: <em>The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet</em> by Becky Chambers.
Once again, I wanted to like this so much. I started reading it twice, spaced
about 18 months apart. But each time, I just couldn't get into it, and
abandoned it about 1/3 in. It is indubitably me, not you.</p>

<p><em>by Genevieve Gornichec, 2021.</em></p>
<p>Old Norse mythology only briefly mentions the witch
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angrbo%C3%B0a">AngrboÃ°a</a>,
as the mother of three "monsters", fathered by the trickster god, Loki. This
book explores her life, explicitly acknowledging her erasure as a woman, and
resolves it, providing her a powerful story, in which she survives men, gods,
and all.</p>
<p>Another fantastic Suze recommendation. Loved it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Also this month: <em>The Emperess of Salt and Fortune</em> by Nghi Vo. I wanted to
like this sooo much, and can see so many things about that are wonderful, but
for some reason I just couldn't get in the mood. The problem is indubitably me,
not you.</p>

<p><em>by Madeline Miller, 2018.</em></p>
<p>Recommended by The Suze, after reading it for one of her book clubs,
and I absolutely loved it.</p>
<p>Tells the life story of the mythical Circe of the ancient Greek pantheon.
Daughter of Helios, mightiest of the Titans, Circe is driven from her family by
their capricious cruelty. She puts her meagre supernatural talents to work in
service of witchcraft, amongst mortals. Along the way she meets many well-known
mythological characters, such as Odysseus, and the Cretean Minotaur.</p>
<p>It was the writing style that captivated me. A timeless, elegant style uses
powerful turns of phrase to spin a tale of drama and high passions, soaked
in the psychological resonances so typical of Greek mythology.
This style, along with the setting, reminded me powerfully of another favourite
couple of novels of recent years, Mary Renault's absolutely fabulous <em>The King
Must Die</em> and <em>The Bull From the Sea</em>.</p>
<p>Circe is my favorite book of the year so far, beating out even the marvellous
<em><a href="posts/klara-and-the-sun">Klara and the Sun</a></em>.</p>
