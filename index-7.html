<p><em>by Jared Diamond</em></p>
<p>A brilliant tome from the same bloke who penned <em>Guns, Germs and Steel</em>.
This time he examines the flip side of the equation - what
characteristics cause civilisations to fail? From the statues of Easter
Island to the Mayan Ruins, the world is replete with the abandoned
relics of cultures that collapsed. Diamond examines seven examples of
societies whose members all died or dispersed, sometimes over a period
of just a few years, leaving their hauntingly abandoned habitats,
looking for the common factors which lead to their demise. The
implications for our own culture are serious. Do we have more in common
with these failed civilisations, or with the ones that exhibited
long-term stability? Will our own skyscrapers one day stand as
hauntingly abandoned monuments amongst jungle or desert? It's a serious
message, and the immediate conclusion looks a little grim, as our rabid
consumerism and resource consumption is anything but steady-state.
However, Diamond finds a silver lining, presenting his conclusions as a
message of hope. We are the first civilisation to have a global reach,
and to have knowledge of ancient societies that have gone before, so
while the stakes are higher than ever, so is our ability to forsee the
consequences of our actions, and to change our course before it's too
late.</p>
<p>Rating: 8/10 - a fascinating and important read.</p>

<p>Another of my occasional theatre trips inspired by <a href="http://libbypenn.com">the
Libster</a>, and jolly lovely it was too. Being a bit
of a cultural dolt, I've neither seen nor read Othello before, so while
everyone else was basking in the familiarity of well-crafted dialog, I
was alternately on tenterhooks or else all choked up, bless.</p>
<p>Chiwetel Ejiofor (left), known to me only through his part in the
geekspasm of Serenity, presented a warm and charismatic Othello, which
served to highlight his later descent into jealousy and madness. The
treachery of Ewan McGregor's Iago seemed unjustified within the context
of the play itself - is it to be assumed that Iago is motivated by
simple racism, or something more explicitly framed which passed me by?
Nevertheless, McGregor's Shakespearean debut seemed to me to be a
compelling performance.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the director's use of light and shadow to represent various
locations, as well as the acoustics, which augmented several of Iago's
scheming monologues with an imperceptible bass rumble, which gradually
rose to a ominous distant roaring, as though the engines of his inner
demons were fit to burst through the walls. I also fancy I caught
changes in the properties of a very gentle electronically injected
reverb on the actor's voices, to model the auditory properties of each
scene's environment, which provided subtle but deeply suggestive cues as
to the size and type of each setting, from small stone rooms, large
wooden halls, through to outdoor environments deadened by foliage.</p>

<p>A special highlight, as is so often the case, is the image
featured in the exhibition's promotions, <em>Sophia</em> (left), by Billy &amp;
Hells, one in a series of photographs that emulates the type of lighting
effects favoured by Dutch golden age painters.</p>
<p>Other than that though, the exhibition left me somewhat flat, consisting
pretty much exclusively of the usual crop of east-European peasants;
sullen, pubescent girls in various states of undress; and of course Sir
Ian Mckellen. I guess it's inevitable, but it's a shame to turn up to an
exhibit, especially one as small as this, only to find that you've
already seen the best bits on the posters on the tube.</p>

    <p>I recently penned the following for my local
<a href="http://www.no2id.net/">No2ID</a> mailing list (the Camden &amp; Islington
branches)...</p>
<p>For what it's worth, I worked briefly on one of the failed Government IT
projects mentioned in the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/jan/04/computing.politics?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront">Guardian
article</a>
referenced on this list a couple of days back. I just wanted to share a
brief perspective of that, in case it's useful or interesting for anyone
contemplating the possible woes of the Government's national ID card and
database projects...</p>
<p>The consultants on projects like this have tailored their behaviour to
maximise profits in the environment they find themselves in. That is to
be expected - so long as they operate within the law they can be neither
blamed for that nor expected to change of their own accord.</p>
<p>The stratagems they use to maximise profits include a thorough sabotage
of project technical deliverables, such that projects appear to make
progress towards achievable goals, thus avoiding cancellation, but in
actuality will require endless rounds of deep rework and extra funding
in order to deliver a system actually does anything useful.</p>
<p>Every extra pound spent in this way is an extra pound billed to the
client (the Government), and every pound billed earns markups and
ongoing overheads. So for the contractors, the way to make the most
money is to drag the project on for as long possible, spending as much
money as they can along the way, without ever actually delivering
anything that works. The results of incentivising contractors this way
speak for themselves.</p>
<p>Of course, if such abuses were too explicit, that would give the client
a means to sue and wriggle out of contracts, jeopardising future income.
Fortunately for the contractors, the process of producing large (or even
medium-sized) IT systems is difficult and murky enough for the desired
disruption to be practically self-organising, given the correct
environment for incubation. Badly-judged technical architecture,
addiction to proprietary standards, wishy-washy technical leadership,
and good old-fashioned hiding of incompetence using imaginative
misrepresentation, these will pretty much do the job. Black-ops meetings
in smoke-filled rooms are undoubtedly only used as a last resort, and
did not, during the period of my employment, produce any requirement to
directly solicit the services of my own pay grade as a saboteur.</p>
<p>Presumably this state of affairs persists because Government actors are
not being held accountable for the success or otherwise of projects
under their control. If that were to change, then the Government could
possibly improve the situation by lowering the barriers to entry for
competing IT consultants and contractors, and showing some negotiating
guts to restructure the way contractors are rewarded, thus introducing
some real competition amongst technology providers to deliver something
that actually works.</p>
<p>That this hasn't already happened says to me that Government actors are
ensnared in some sort of corruption - by which I don't necessarily mean
an explicitly dishonest kind. The situation could charitably be
interpreted to include what I term <a href="http://wiki.lessig.org/index.php/Corruption">'passive
corruption'</a> - the kind of
poorly aligned incentives or incompetence which leads to similar
outcomes as traditional corruption. (For more thoughts on how passive
corruption of this kind affects society, see the excellent writings of
<a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/">Lawrence Lessig</a>.)</p>
<p>While it's in all our interests for this situation to get fixed in order
to improve our Government's effectiveness, I see no hope that this will
happen soon. Fortunately for No2ID this sad state of affairs provides us
with the ammunition that the ID card and database projects are unlikely
to work well, and are likely to cost significantly more than current
projections, which I agree should be exploited as has been outlined
adroitly by others, on this list and elsewhere.</p>

    <p><img alt="Naked Wii" src="files/2008/01/wii.jpg"></p>
<p>Over Christmas a friend was looking for somewhere with Wii's
in stock. I saw a local <em>Game</em> outlet had some, but I discovered they
only had them bundled with three or more (rubbish) games, for an extra
eighty quid over the RRP. Twice I returned, to find the same.</p>
<p>I object to bundling like this, which reduces consumer choice in the
games they buy, and is a flagrant rip-off, taking advantage of customers
struggling to find a Wii, which has consistently sold out ever since it
was launched.</p>
<p>It turns out that Nintendo object to bundling too, since it artificially
increases the Wii's asking price, undermining the console's position as
cheapest current-gen offering. Their official policy is to reduce
shipments of Wii's (read: boxes full of cash) to infringing retail
outlets.</p>
<p>With this in mind I discovered that, even after assuring me they had
none available, the store management and staff would then practically
fall over themselves to press an unbundled Wii into my hands for RRP, as
soon as I started asking for the store number and manager's name.</p>
<p>The bastards.</p>

<p>I read through this to assess the iPhone (many thanks to the
generosity and resourcefulness of a certain <a href="http://amoral.org/">Mr
Smithson</a>) as an eBook reader, and found it
surprisingly good - certainly the best device I've tried to date,
surpassing even the silky-screened PSP. The text is clear and relaxing
(better looking than the hurried mock-up I Gimped together on the left),
page turning or scrolling through chapters are both unobtrusive and
highly functional. The whole experience was very pleasing - I could read
comfortably off the iPhone for hours on end. I'm reminded of the post I
wrote back in '98: "I'm going to try out this new thing called
Napster..." The revolutions begins here - let the book-burning commence.</p>
<p>As for the words themselves, they were a very entertaining read. Mr
Franklin is evidently a singularly able individual who led an
interesting life full of achievement. I'd never before taken stock of
just how very industrious he must have been to straddle so many spheres
of influence, a fact which he misses no opportunity to remind us of. His
every week is seemingly filled with some new scheme for relentless
self-improvement, impressing local dignitaries with his perspicacity and
diligence, or else compiling lists of virtues, so that he might
regularly apprise his behaviour in their light. I noted with wry
amusement the suggestion by a friend of his to add 'humility' to his
list, of which Franklin reports "I cannot boast of much success in
acquiring the reality of this virtue, but I had a good deal with regard
to the appearance of it." Quite.</p>
<p>However, it is mean spirited of me to begrudge him that trifle in light
of his achievements, and in particular, the spirit of honesty and
justice with which he undertakes every aspect of his life. I'm a firm
believer that the winners write history, and have on more than one
occasion pondered the lofty ideals of the founding fathers as a superb
marketing spin to popularise an act of treason. However, whether it was
spin or not, the lofty ideals stuck, bequeathing us the better part of
the disposition of modern America, for which the Western world owes him
an unending debt of gratitude.</p>
<p>Rating: 8/10. Hoorah Mr Franklin!</p>
