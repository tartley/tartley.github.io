# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#

# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Commented out to use Github Pages version of Jekyll.
# gem "jekyll", "~> 3.7.3"

# This is the default theme for new Jekyll sites.
gem "minima", "~> 2.0"

# To upgrade, run `bundle update github-pages`.
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem "jekyll-feed", "~> 0.6"
end

# Commented out because Windows.
#
# # Windows does not include zoneinfo files, so bundle the tzinfo-data gem
# gem "tzinfo-data", platforms: [:mingw, :mswin, :x64_mingw, :jruby]
#
# # Performance-booster for watching directories on Windows
