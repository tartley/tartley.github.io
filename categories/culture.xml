Spotted this in some of Kurt Vonnegut's personal
correspondence, talking about an instructor of his named Slotkin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Slotkin said was this: no man who achieved greatness in the arts operated
by himself; he was top man in a group of like-minded individuals. This works
out fine for the cubists, and Slotkin had plenty of good evidence for its
applying to Goethe, Thoreau, Hemingway, and just about anybody you care to
name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this isn't 100% true, it's true enough to be interesting—and maybe helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school gives a man, Slotkin said, the fantastic amount of guts it takes to
add to culture. It gives him morale, esprit de corps, the resources of many
brains, and—maybe most important—one-sidedness with assurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminds me powerfully of my growing impressions of the environment a person
needs to be in in order to do great things in software. There is no doubt some
effectiveness in assembling great individuals to create a great team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in my personal experience, there is a whole lot &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; value in creating a
great team by instilling the right values, and then watching the members
visibly level each other up, producing a succession of great individuals,
and only subsequently attracting more of the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>culture</category><category>greatness</category><category>literature</category><category>software</category><category>vonnegut</category><guid>https://tartley.com/posts/vonnegut-on-software-development-teams/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 02:28:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Makers</title><link>https://tartley.com/posts/makers/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float: left"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Cory Doctorow&lt;/em&gt; (not yet published.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://craphound.com/"&gt;Cory&lt;/a&gt; very kindly brought an early manuscript of
this as a gift to &lt;a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www.gilesthomas.com/"&gt;Giles&lt;/a&gt; and I when we met him a while ago,
and I've been wracked with guilt ever since because I apparently lost it
soon after. Thankfully, it recently turned up (on
&lt;a href="http://babbageclunk.com/"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt;'s desk - my fault!) last week, so
I happily finished it pronto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's his best fiction yet! He must be honing his abilities with
practice. \o/ Michael do you want it next?.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian doesn't like my subjectivity-proof rating system, so this one
is specially for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/10 if you want a lightly styled but deeply speculative and engrossing
story that winds a like a sightseeing tour around the social and
personal ramifications of the ways in which modern technology is
changing the way people interact, organise and get things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0/10: If you aren't interested in the ways society is changing under our
feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Lawrence Lessig&lt;/em&gt;, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is creating a mix CD for a friend an act of creativity, or a criminal
offence? When you shoot a home video of your child which has a TV on in
the background, is there really any need for lawsuits? What business do
federal laws have in trying to regulate this sort of activity anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those, like me, who view modern copyright law as a morass of
intractable problems, irreconcilable interests, overreaching government
intervention and profoundly unfair restrictions on personal freedoms,
Professor Lessig's words are a welcome infusion of clarity, pragmatism
and respect for all interested parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an engaging and accessible style, he describes exactly what is
wrong with modern copyright, with clarity and impartiality, and why this
is a deep and pervasive problem that cuts to the heart of all that we
value in human culture. He describes how fixing this would benefit each
of us, from individual consumers and amateur producers, through
professional writers, musicians and copyright holders. Then, in a
surprisingly constructive final section, he outlines five simple changes
to copyright law that would, at a stroke, fix all the major problems,
vastly simplify the situation, eliminate the ambiguity over the legality
of our everyday actions, and all without apparently causing any harm or
loss to any interested party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/10 If you have any interest in the forces that are reshaping our
society and turning industries upside-down within the space of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0/10 If you dislike freedom or free markets, or are a big fan of
overbearing government regulation and monopolies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Clay Shirky (2008)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shirky has thrown a few beautiful and insightful essays over the wall
the last few months. He is the guy who penned the '&lt;a href="http://www.herecomeseverybody.org/2008/04/looking-for-the-mouse.html"&gt;Gin, Television and
Social
Surplus&lt;/a&gt;'
piece a while back. It's a joy to find that this book is up to the same
standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In it, he explains how the social changes enabled by recent technology
are profoundly and permanently altering the ways in which human beings
interact, form groups, and get things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is making activities and projects possible which could never have
been dreamed of even ten years ago, and is similarly displacing many
established institutions. The greatest effects of this change will be
seen when the technology has progressed to the point of invisibility,
and the current upheavals in the music and newspaper industries are just
the leading edge of the wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a change no less significant than the invention of the printing
press, in terms of its ability to transform societal institutions. We do
indeed live in interesting times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating 10/10 - everyone should read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Paul Graham (2004)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd already stumbled across many of the &lt;a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html"&gt;individual
essays&lt;/a&gt; that this is comprised
of, but it was still hugely entertaining and educational to discover
some of Graham's essays that I hadn't read yet. He covers a wide variety
of topics, and inevitably for such a collection, the components vary in
quality, but generally they are extremely engaging. I only regret having
to grab them in dead-tree format since I lost my iPhone. Ohdeary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 8/10 - a brilliant read&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Lawrence Lessig (2004)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessible, entertaining, rich with historical perspective, and cuts
incisively to the core of modern society's conflict over intellectual
property. To my mind, one of the most important books of the decade. I'd
highly recommend it. And it's available for free from your iPhone's
built-in ebooks installer, or
&lt;a href="http://www.free-culture.cc/freecontent/"&gt;as a pdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="The Hacker Crackdown" src="https://tartley.com/files/2008/01/hacker-crackdown.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Bruce Sterling, &lt;a href="http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=hacker%20crackdown%20AND%20mediatype%3Aaudio%20AND%20collection%3Aopensource_audio"&gt;read aloud by Cory Doctorow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only the second audiobook I've bothered to listen to, and it seems to
work very well, especially when commuting, since you can continue
listening without interruption while leaving the tube and walking. (It's
taken me 36 years to figure this out? Genius.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cory does a fine job of reading, and I'm grateful to him for bringing
this important book to my attention. When he describes reading it on
it's publication in 1994 as 'life changing', I can understand why. It
describes the clash of cultures resulting from American law
enforcement's attempts to crack down on the hackers, crackers and
phreaks of the nascent cyberpunk underworld of the early '90s. Many of
the underlying issues have even more relevance today. Can taking a copy
of digital information be equated with stealing, given that the original
owner still retains their original copy? Or is it more analogous to
attempting to overhear a conversation which the speakers would rather
wasn't overheard? While some hackers have real criminal intent, there
are a significant proportion with a very strong ethic to do no harm, who
view their tinkering as merely the exploration of an online frontier,
filled with challenges and puzzles, and rewards of rich hordes of
information - the dispersal of which is not just a god-given right, but
actually a moral responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When law enforcement agencies went after this crowd with a heavy-handed
and indiscriminate approach, teenagers still living with their parents
ended up in court facing years in prison, colossal fines and legal fees,
in some instances simply for simply republishing a document that was
already in widespread circulation. Innocents had tens of thousands of
dollars worth of computers seized and never returned, even though no
charges were ever filed against them. The resulting backlash formed the
beginnings of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a philanthropic
organization devoted to defending the rights of individuals in the
online realm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole tale is laced with many entertaining insights into the quirks
and motives of the colorful individuals involved, and this makes the
whole thing an enjoyable romp through a serious topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 8/10 - I only wish I'd read it ten years ago&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="12 Books That Changed The World" src="https://tartley.com/files/2007/06/12books-that-changed-the-world.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Melvyn Bragg (2006)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brilliant assembly of potted snippets of history, ideal for someone
like myself with scarcely a glimmer of an education. By cunning omission
of the definite article, Bragg gets to talk not just about 12 important
books, but is able to manipulate the list such that it is all about 12
&lt;em&gt;British&lt;/em&gt; books, a move I heartily approve of. Apparently written to
accompany some television series, I neither knew nor cared. For the
record, his selection is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="clear: both"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Principia Mathematica&lt;/em&gt; by Isaac Newton, 1687. "Will always have a
    pre-eminance above all the other works of human genius."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Married Love&lt;/em&gt; by Marie Stopes, 1918. Transformed the married lives
    of a whole generation, furthering the rights of women, and making it
    possible to broach subjects that had been entirely taboo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Magna Carta&lt;/em&gt; by Members of the English ruling classes, 1215. The
    fundamental origins of the English constitution, setting up a
    balance of powers which forms the basis and language for many others
    since, including America and India.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rule Book of Association Football&lt;/em&gt; by a group of former English
    public school men. Codifying the most popular game on the planet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt; by Charles Darwin, 1859. The greatest and
    most far-reaching scientific theory yet produced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the Abolition of the Slave Trade&lt;/em&gt; an oration by William
    Wilberforce in Parliament, 1789. This was published immediately
    after his oration in parliament, forming a cornerstone of the
    anti-slave trade movement, and eventually leading to the abolition
    of the slave trade just days before Wilberforce's death, a move
    that, in subsequent decades, was emulated by nations all over the
    world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Vindication of the Rights of Women&lt;/em&gt; by Mary
    Wollsenstonecraft, 1792. The first great feminine thesis, coming at
    a time when the world sorely needed it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experimental Researches in Electricity&lt;/em&gt; by Michael Faraday,
    1839-55. A study in dedication and impartial perseverance, resulting
    in an astonishing number of discoveries which now affect the
    everyday lives of billions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Patent Specification for Arkwright's Spinning Machine&lt;/em&gt; by Richard
    Arkwright, 1769. Trailblazer for a commerce-fuelled industrial
    revolution that shows no signs of slowing down in its transformation
    of the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The King James Bible&lt;/em&gt; by fifty-four scholars appointed by the
    King, 1611. A beautiful construction that has contributed more
    phrases and expressions to the English language than any other
    source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations&lt;/em&gt; by
    Adam Smith, 1776. Transformed views of how wealth was to be measured
    and generated, practically inventing capitalism along the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The First Folio&lt;/em&gt; by William Shakespeare, 1623. No other work of
    fiction, religious texts aside, can match the cultural influence and
    endearing effect on our language that this body of work has had.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9/10 if you know nothing, like what I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/10 if you've already read all the entries in his list, like I haven't.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>book</category><category>culture</category><category>history</category><category>media</category><category>non-fiction</category><guid>https://tartley.com/posts/12-books-that-changed-the-world/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jun 2007 13:14:17 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
