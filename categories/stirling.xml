&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, 1990&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick re-read, inspired by a recent visit to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/"&gt;the Science
Museum&lt;/a&gt;, where we were enthralled by
our meanderings around various astonishing artifacts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rickety-looking &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_10"&gt;Apollo
  10&lt;/a&gt; capsule, charred from
  re-entry, having journeyed to within 9 miles of the moon and back
  again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephenson%27s_Rocket"&gt;Stevenson's
  Rocket&lt;/a&gt;, not, as
  I had previously understood, the first steam-powered railway
  locomotive, just a revolutionary improvement in design, capable of
  the unheard-of speed of 29 miles an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson and Crick's original 6-foot mechano model of the double-helix
  structure of a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"&gt;DNA molecule&lt;/a&gt; (or
  at least the original bits of it, re-assembled at Kings around
  1990), constructed between LSD fuelled revelry and Sunday
  afternoons' quiet boozing pondering the meaning of life. Not a bad
  lifestyle, it has to be said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Babbage's Difference Engine number 1, or at least remnants
  of it. This is the arithmetic precursor to his subsequent, and more
  ambitious, analytical engine, the conception of which was a precient
  stroke of genius, the world's first programmable computer. Lacking
  electronics, it was implemented in a purely mechanical manner, a 40
  year labour of which he pursued until his death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised to learn that the failing of the device was not, as I
had previously heard, due to the inadequate manufacturing tolerances of
the time. Recent examinations have demonstrated these to be more than
adequate. Instead, the lengthy and costly extensions to the project,
leading to its eventual failure in an ocean of debts and soured
relationships is nowadays blamed on the project suffering from
'inappropriate management'. Interesting to see the nascent software
industry starting out as it was destined to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was, of course, this last item at the museum which inspired me to
pick up &lt;em&gt;The Difference Engine&lt;/em&gt; paperback again, an alternate history
novel in which the authors indulge the fantasy that Babbage's project
had been a success, and the British Empire, in the upheaval of a
steam-powered information processing era, underwent a series of
meritocratous social revolutions, and as a result was better equipped to
continue its expansion across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating 7.5/10 - a splendid ripping yarn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="The Hacker Crackdown" src="https://tartley.com/files/2008/01/hacker-crackdown.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Bruce Sterling, &lt;a href="http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=hacker%20crackdown%20AND%20mediatype%3Aaudio%20AND%20collection%3Aopensource_audio"&gt;read aloud by Cory Doctorow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only the second audiobook I've bothered to listen to, and it seems to
work very well, especially when commuting, since you can continue
listening without interruption while leaving the tube and walking. (It's
taken me 36 years to figure this out? Genius.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cory does a fine job of reading, and I'm grateful to him for bringing
this important book to my attention. When he describes reading it on
it's publication in 1994 as 'life changing', I can understand why. It
describes the clash of cultures resulting from American law
enforcement's attempts to crack down on the hackers, crackers and
phreaks of the nascent cyberpunk underworld of the early '90s. Many of
the underlying issues have even more relevance today. Can taking a copy
of digital information be equated with stealing, given that the original
owner still retains their original copy? Or is it more analogous to
attempting to overhear a conversation which the speakers would rather
wasn't overheard? While some hackers have real criminal intent, there
are a significant proportion with a very strong ethic to do no harm, who
view their tinkering as merely the exploration of an online frontier,
filled with challenges and puzzles, and rewards of rich hordes of
information - the dispersal of which is not just a god-given right, but
actually a moral responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When law enforcement agencies went after this crowd with a heavy-handed
and indiscriminate approach, teenagers still living with their parents
ended up in court facing years in prison, colossal fines and legal fees,
in some instances simply for simply republishing a document that was
already in widespread circulation. Innocents had tens of thousands of
dollars worth of computers seized and never returned, even though no
charges were ever filed against them. The resulting backlash formed the
beginnings of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a philanthropic
organization devoted to defending the rights of individuals in the
online realm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole tale is laced with many entertaining insights into the quirks
and motives of the colorful individuals involved, and this makes the
whole thing an enjoyable romp through a serious topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 8/10 - I only wish I'd read it ten years ago&lt;/p&gt;
