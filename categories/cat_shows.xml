&lt;p&gt;Another of my occasional theatre trips inspired by &lt;a href="http://libbypenn.com"&gt;the
Libster&lt;/a&gt;, and jolly lovely it was too. Being a bit
of a cultural dolt, I've neither seen nor read Othello before, so while
everyone else was basking in the familiarity of well-crafted dialog, I
was alternately on tenterhooks or else all choked up, bless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiwetel Ejiofor (left), known to me only through his part in the
geekspasm of Serenity, presented a warm and charismatic Othello, which
served to highlight his later descent into jealousy and madness. The
treachery of Ewan McGregor's Iago seemed unjustified within the context
of the play itself - is it to be assumed that Iago is motivated by
simple racism, or something more explicitly framed which passed me by?
Nevertheless, McGregor's Shakespearean debut seemed to me to be a
compelling performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the director's use of light and shadow to represent various
locations, as well as the acoustics, which augmented several of Iago's
scheming monologues with an imperceptible bass rumble, which gradually
rose to a ominous distant roaring, as though the engines of his inner
demons were fit to burst through the walls. I also fancy I caught
changes in the properties of a very gentle electronically injected
reverb on the actor's voices, to model the auditory properties of each
scene's environment, which provided subtle but deeply suggestive cues as
to the size and type of each setting, from small stone rooms, large
wooden halls, through to outdoor environments deadened by foliage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 8/10 - Hurrah I loved it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Shows</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/2008/1/23/othello-donmar-warehouse.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jan 2008 02:04:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Hothouse</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/2007/7/22/the-hothouse.html</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The Hothouse" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/07/hothouse.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Harold Pinter, 1958.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Directed by Ian Rickson.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;At the National Theatre's Lyttelton theatre.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was forewarned is typical of Pinter, difficult to untangle a point,
but nevertheless both chilling and amusing in turns. Having said that,
I'd really have to go and read all about it before I could decide
whether I actually liked it or not, which I guess means that currently I
don't. 4/10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Shows</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/2007/7/22/the-hothouse.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jul 2007 06:31:10 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Avenue Q</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/2007/3/21/avenue-q.html</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/03/aveq-screen_ps01_big.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I promised myself I'd endure no more musicals, but somehow an exception
seems appropriate for this beautiful idiocy. Sometimes muppets can say
what men cannot.&lt;/p&gt;

Director: Nicholas Hytner.
Theatre: Wyndham's.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a lengthy run at the National Theatre, and then a national tour,
this production marks the play's return to the West End, enlivened by a
whole new cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tale revolves around a class of bright and boisterous schoolboys,
under the tutelage of two particular teachers; Hector, a middle-aged
General Studies teacher, who spurns the concept of curriculum and
examinations in favour of individual intellectual exploration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The school gives them an education. I give them the wherewithal to
resist it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;versus a younger, more efficient History teacher, focussed on a more
prescriptive methodology, providing a palette of intellectual
sleights-of-hand designed specifically to get them through the Oxbridge
entrance exams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Director Hytner effectively introduces the play, and many scenes within
it, using short video clips of the characters within school settings,
set to gleefully evocative gems of 1980's pop. This immersed me in
memories of Grange Hill and my own school days even before the first
line, and the rest of the play rolled on in a similarly involving,
humorous and touching manner. From its initial premise, the story
expands to subject the cast to a gamut of emotions, including (spoiler
warning) a thoughtful yet uncomplicated exploration of recurrent sexual
abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pupils enact occasional scenes from classic movies with mock
gravity, notably selected to highlight the famously British trend of
repressed emotion, and in many ways that is a recurrent theme of the
play, the way emotions are hidden, redirected and how they then come
out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, smashing and involving - time well spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 7/10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Shows</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/2007/3/1/the-history-boys.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2007 17:26:06 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
