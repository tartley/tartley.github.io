&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Umberto Eco, 1995.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eco's prose has left me in the dust on occasion in the past. I missed so many references, or failed to keep up with the relentlessly nested layers of meaning, that I was simply holding on for the ride. This essay matches Eco's characteristically dense, intellectual prose, studded with foreign phrases, and references to contemporary thinkers, historical movements and causes and revolutions and dictatorships, and their antecedents. But it is short, and perhaps in contrast to the flourishes of brilliance that comprise his fiction, this is a factual piece, and is written to be understood rather than to dazzle. It begins by establishing Eco's credentials to speak on this topic, with the first of several entrancing first-hand indications of what it was like to grow up as an intellectual young child in Italy under Mussolini, and the revelations that followed at the opening up of his world at the end of WWII.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He differentiates between the truly totalitarian fascism of, say, Nazism, which subordinated all of life to the state, with the looser, less coherent Italian fascism, noting that this did not derive from any increment of tolerance, merely the absence of a sufficiently encompassing underlying philosophy. Despite this, it is the Italian mode, which was the first right wing dictatorship in modern history, from which subsequent dictators seem to have drawn most stylistic inspiration, and from which our generic term of "fascism" derives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last half of the essay describes how fascism means different things in different contexts, but the various incarnations through history have exhibited sufficiently overlapping sets of symptoms as to glean a family resemblance. Eco enumerates 13 identifying traits, noting that the presence of even one of them can be sufficient to allow fascism to coagulate around it. Mostly for my own benefit, (with my own parenthesised observations) they are, briefly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fascism incorporates a cult of tradition. This can be deployed as an automatic refutation of any undesirable new ideas, enshrining in their place the immutable wisdom of a mythical past. In addition, traditionalism undermines the perceived value of learning in itself - pre-emptively thwarting troublesome intellectuals. This anti-intellectual received wisdom, in order to provide whichever justifications are required of it, requires the syncretistic combination of various ancient beliefs. As a result it must tolerate contradictions. Indeed, the more stark they are, the better they serve the purpose of selecting followers who will obediently think whatever they are told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rejection of modernism. This is a powerful recruiting tool, enabling the fascist to leverage any dissatisfaction of the populous, laying claim to the emotionally appealing universal solution of a regression to simpler, happier times, while simultaneously rewinding societal progress in equality or liberty. While Nazis and fascists love their technology, this is a superficial tool, used in support of a deeply regressive project, namely the restoration of power to those with the strength and the will to take it. This irrationality goes hand in hand with anti-intellectualism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value vigor and action above reflection. Thinking is emasculation. Culture is suspect insofar as it aligns with any sort of critical theory or values. Regard centers of analysis or learning such as libraries or universities with suspicion for harboring - or even indoctrinating - people of opposing political viewpoints. Again, this is deeply intertwined with (1) &amp;amp; (2), and its prevalence pre-emptively defuses any kind of mainstream understanding or critique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above make it inevitable that any given fascist regime will be rife with internal contradictions.  While modernity achieves its intellectual prowess through the nurturing of diverse thought, fascism cannot possibly withstand any critical analysis. Hence, disagreement is treason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fascist appeal to popularity exploits and exacerbates the natural fear of &lt;em&gt;the other&lt;/em&gt;, and hence is always inherently racist. Expect demonization of immigrants, foreigners, other nation states, as well as other marginalized groups, taking advantage of whatever local contemporary biases and fears might be present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above exploitation takes the form of an appeal to the frustrations of the middle class - or whichever class can be most useful and readily mobilized by persuasion that their problems are caused by some identifiable other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernity genuinely does disintegrate traditional social bonds, along with sources of identity and meaning. Fascism's solution to this is to unify the disaffected under the only remaining banner common to them all, that of patriotism and nationalism. This unity is strengthened by emphasis on the country's enemies, and especially by conspiracy theories of secret international plots against the nation. Followers must feel besieged (as Trump advised the January 6th crowd that "America is under siege"). Eco makes special mention, in the U.S, of Pat Robertson's &lt;em&gt;The New World Order&lt;/em&gt;, but potential sources of conspiracy are innumerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Followers can be riled into frenzy of humiliation at their enemies' wealth or power. Jews control the
world and its money. Instead of coastal liberals, refer to coastal elites. But at the same time, the instinct to action requires that enemies can easily be defeated. Hence enemies are simultaneously too weak and too strong. Herein lies one of fascism's greatest weaknesses, responsible for several lost wars, in that it is constitutionally incapable of objectively assessing an enemy's strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goad followers into violent action with rhetoric not just of a struggle for survival, but by declaration that life is struggle, and hence pacifism is conspiring with the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While fascism appeals for the participation of the population by promising empowerment for the majority, its naked power lust is a fundamentally aristocratic endeavor. The leader takes power from those too weak to oppose  him, disdaining both conquered rivals and the subjugated population. Power struggles within the Party are vicious, and the party rides roughshod over the citizens, who likewise are leagues above the disenfranchised. The hierarchy is strict, steep, and ruthless. Elitism abounds, as does fear of losing one's status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The redress of modernity's threadbare social fabric, by emphasizing nationalism and strength, further erodes interpersonal solidarity. Each individual must becomes their own hero. Strong, independent, and utterly without recourse in times of need. The cult of the hero is intimately entwined with a cult of death. Having only the narrow causes of the nation and the Party to live for, the hero yearns for a heroic death - or, better, to demonstrate their power and status by sending others to their death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preeminent will to power, so often frustrated in an aristocratic, dog-eat-dog social order, manifests alternately in things like machismo, disdain for women, and phallic fetishization of weapons. Repressed insecurity breeds an outward contempt for unconventional sexuality, including chastity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under fascism, the people have no innate rights, and hence no material preferences or expression. Instead, the leader pretends to interpret the Will of the People. This charade requires the party apparatus to select and amplify some emotional response of the people, and present it as representative, so that the party can be empowered to act on behalf of that supposedly majority. Consider the amplifications of manufactured outrage about culture war issues, so that elected representatives are empowered to act decisively on their own preferences, against the majority of the population's wishes. This leads directly to confrontation with institutions such as a parliament. Fascism will therefore cast aspersions on any properly functioning parliament's legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All fascisms make use of their own varieties of NewSpeak, using an impoverished vocabulary and syntax, in order to limit the instruments for critical reasoning. This may appear in apparently innocent forms, from schoolbooks to popular talk shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;img alt="Spoilers" src="https://tartley.com/files/spoilers.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major spoilers ahead. It's seven years old at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt="Soma - protagonist" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/soma-protagonist.webp"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soma is a creepy survival horror game, that leans deeply into the moral and
existential quandaries arising from the deterministic principle that it's
possible to scan one's brain and copy the structure into some other substrate,
yielding a second conscious entity, which thinks it is you. So there are deep
science-fiction issues in play here, about whether we think such a scheme could
ever possibly work, and about the practical, personal, and societal
ramifications of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved the setup. A humdrum morning begins in your present-day Toronto
apartment. A note on the fridge reminds you that today is the day of your
medical appointment, a brain scan. Reaching the doctor's office by train, you
find the experimental new type of brain scanner, run by some PhD in a
cable-strewn side-office. Sit in the chair, don the helmet, wait for the scan
to complete and- blink! Suddenly, you are elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the game progresses, it becomes obvious that the version of you that sat
down in the seat did not experience this discontinuity. They completed the
scan, removed the helmet, and continued their normal, everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are not that copy. You open your eyes to a grim, decrepit cyberpunk future.
Exploring, your only company is a menagerie of half-functional robots and
drones, many of which are insane, and, in conversation, seem to be under the
impression that they are human beings. It gradually becomes apparent that
perceptual filters are in play, preventing them - and you - from noticing they
are no longer human. At one point the ocean crashes in on you, and you drown
for a little while, or at least think you are, but you still don't die. At that
point you have to acknowledge the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have awoken to the year 2104, and the recorded brain scans of real humans
are being used to animate drones. This is a scenario much like that told from a
different perspective in the smashing short story
&lt;a href="https://qntm.org/mmacevedo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by qntm.
Failing systems engaged fall-backs, resulting in your obsolete brain scan being
yanked from storage to inhabit an advanced humanoid robot, in a facility deep
under the ocean, some time after a comet strike has scoured all life from the
planet's surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that wasn't bad enough, one facilitating technology of this nightmarish
scenario, a black goo that mimics and improves upon electrical and biological
circuitry it comes into contact with, has run rampant, growing probing tendrils
which are wrecking the facility. Among other effects, it has reanimated the
corpses of the last few humans, who skulk around, not in a good way. As our
protagonist asks, incredulously, "You mean they've been brought back to life?".
Our reassuring AI companion replies "Yeah, let's call it that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game borrows the highly effective mechanics of Frictional's previous games,
the Amnesia and Penumbra series, where the proximity of horrific, shambling
enemies causes your character to experience debilitating symptoms, including,
in this case, static-y visual distortions as your neural hardware suffers from
some overload or interference. This applies even if you simply look at an
enemy, an act which immediately draws their attention. So your only chance to
survive encounters is to stay well out of sight, and actively avert your eyes
so you can't even watch what's going on. Not being able to see exactly what
your enemies are, or what they are up to, turns out to be fabulously scary and
atmospheric. At one point it lead directly to my wife catching me staring
intently at a blank, black screen for a prolonged period, with a peculiar
expression on my face, as I hid in a dark cupboard waiting for the slithering
sounds behind me to go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spurring us through this environment are not just threats to our immediate
survival, but also the adoption of a project, to launch into space a
solar-powered simulation, hosting all the last remaining brain scans of the
now-defunct human race, known as the 'ARK'. This will allow the on-board sims
to live a prolonged period of idyllic virtual existence, preserving at least
some echo of what humanity was. Since the conceit of the game is that our
character is a living and conscious entity that feels real emotion, the sims on
the ARK are all presumably the same, so this seems like a worthwhile endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are guided, motivated, and assisted by "Catherine", a simulated personality
running on our hand-held omni-tool, based on the brain recording of an AI
researcher, whose project during her lifetime was the ARK. Plugging her in to a
wall or console socket lets her interface with our surroundings, activating
power supplies and manipulating machinery. She leads us through a series of
undersea facilities, linked by trains, submersibles, and the occasional
disorienting trudge across the murky ocean floor, stirred up by ferocious
currents and landslides, populated by organic-mechanical hybrid horrors that
glide by in the darkness. I found these some of the absolute best, most
atmospheric "walking simulator" moments I've experienced in a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt="The ocean floor, stirred up by currents and landslides" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/soma-murky.webp"&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Is that another distant light up ahead? Good luck finding them while the currents pummel you,
and hideous, deadly beasts loom out of the murk.
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, we encounter a few unforgettable scenarios. We come across the
failing storage system in which the last remaining copy of our own brain scan
resides. I decide to flip some buttons which delete it, prompting my character
to respond with something like "Let this be the last time I wake up in this
godforsaken place."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At another point, we find ourselves trapped within a collapsing facility on the
bottom of the ocean, with the gibbering undead hammering on the door from the
next room. There is an airlock leading out into the ocean, but we would be
crushed at this depth. There is no way out. Luckily, Catherine is able to guide
us into assembling a more robust robot, one capable of withstanding the
pressure - all we have to do is sit in the chair and activate the transfer into
it. We already did this once, back in Toronto. Easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, after the transfer, we glance back across the lab at our original - the
pictured chap with red LED eyes - who, we notice, is still breathing. Asking
Catherine about it, she reminds us that the brain scan is not a destructive
operation. He's still in there, chemically subdued for the moment, but he'll
soon wake up again, wondering why the transfer didn't work. So we are left with
the option of stomping out of the airlock to safety, leaving him behind to his
nightmarish fate. Or flipping a switch to deactivate him before we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of these narrative beats work better as a game than they perhaps might in
a written story. They emphasize the player's complicity, your moral
culpability, which is a mode that games, for all their faults, can do better
than any other media. Plenty of the lesser moments along the way expose the
player to decisions about unplugging some human simulation or other which
declares itself to be "alive", but which is gating your progress in some way.
Some of them are yourself. Some of these acts require manhandling weighty
cables, which require large, insistent tugging with the mouse controls. It's
not just a disembodied button press. One has to provide a determined,
definitive, mechanical input to end a life. In context, the guilt feels real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the journey, we finally stumble across an honest-to-goodness real,
live human being. She describes how the rest of the humans will be gathered in
particular locations, while she stayed to protect the ARK. But, we tell her, we
just passed through those locations, and there were no humans remaining there.
We both know that the planet's surface is sterile. A beat passes before she
announces "So I'm the last human being left alive." She's deathly sick, and
without hope. By the end of your interactions she asks you to turn off her
life-support before you leave, and stay with her for her last wheezing moments.
So this is how humanity ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrying on, because what else is there to do? We finally we get the ARK loaded
into the launch system that delivers it to orbit, upload our brain scans onto
it just before it launches, and - we've done it! Success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a moment, about five minutes before the end, when I realized what was
going to happen here, even though my character had not. It was a real emotional
blow. I envied and pitied him for his naive hope. For believing there was still
a way out. For, of course, the ARK's launch changed nothing for us. Our
simulations are aboard it, but we are still sitting here, in a broken robot
corpse in a collapsing facility at the bottom of a haunted ocean on a dead
planet. The dispatched copy will enjoy life on the ARK, but we - like the copy
of ourselves we left behind earlier - are stuck here for good.

(2017-2019)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;img alt="Spoilers" src="https://tartley.com/files/spoilers.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/Watchmen1987"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a
seminal 12-issue superhero comic by Alan Moore (writer) &amp;amp; Dave Gibbons
(artist), published from 1986 to 1987, that transformed the comics world. A
superhero tale in which all-but-one of the superheroes have no superhuman
powers at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decades since have spawned a number of remakes, sequels, prequels and
spin-offs. Zach Snyder's movie adaptation has its adherents, and the HBO
miniseries sequel was, in my opinion, excellent. But other than that they have
not been very good. I initially thought the 12 issue sequel &lt;em&gt;Doomsday Clock&lt;/em&gt;
comic would fall solidly into this group, and passed it by when it came out
a couple of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on reading it last week, I really enjoyed it. It really swings for the
fences, providing a smashing tale, with good arcs for both old and new
characters, and a genuine attempt to advance the conversation that &lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt;
started by deconstructing the superhero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We last saw Dr Manhattan at the end of &lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt;, having been isolated from
humanity by Adrien Veidt's plans, tired of his entanglement in the messy
complexity of people's lives, threatening to leave the galaxy "for one less
complicated".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt="Manhattan's departure at the end of Watchmen" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/doomsday-clock-watchmen-manhattan.webp"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Doomsday Clock&lt;/em&gt;, Adrian Veidt, genius that he is, invents a means to follow
Dr Manhattan, seeking his help with the re-emergence of imminent nuclear war
brought about by the revelations in Rorschach's journal, and it becomes clear
that the "simpler place" Dr Manhattan has journeyed to is the DC universe,
populated by Superman, Batman, and the &lt;em&gt;whole&lt;/em&gt; stable of DC heroes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various other &lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt; characters make their way, or are transferred to, the
DC universe. This has been described across the comic industry as "the
crossover event nobody wanted", but personally I felt it was really well done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the most prominently deceased &lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt; characters are brought back
into play, using mechanisms I thought were legitimate and, on occasion,
laugh-out-loud satisfying as they reached their resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt="Doomsday Clock Watchmen Comedian Alive" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/doomsday-clock-comedian.webp"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, they find a way to bring back Rorschach. Or, at least, &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;
Rorschach. Another individual picks up the mask. This seems like the most
controversial of the many decisions in the book, but it's handled deftly, and
there are both similarities and differences between the old and the new
Rorschach, making it an interesting character in its own right. In some ways
this transformation is reminiscent of HBO Watchmen's treatment of Hooded
Justice - retaining everything we already knew about the character, but
performing an astonishing piece of narrative ju-jitsu to utterly transform
everything about what that meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DC heroes slowly realize their world is being altered by Dr Manhattan's
manipulations, tying this crossover into the latest of the DC universe's
"crisis" events, as Manhattan experiments with this reality, in order to
understand it. In doing so, he uncovers deep truths that affect the
inter-relationship between all the DC time-lines and universes, establishing
that historical stories, such as Superman's original appearance in Action
Comics of the 1930s, represent realities that still exist, out in the
multiverse, unaffected by subsequent commercial re-ploughing that forever
drives Superman's origin story further forward in time over the years. All
these worlds, including the various DC pre-crisis worlds, are accessible to
Manhattan's powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, this enables DC to undo the changes wrought by the last few
years' unpopular "New 52" era. This meant nothing to me when I started reading,
I know basically nothing about American comics, only being familiar with the
fabulous British &lt;em&gt;2000AD&lt;/em&gt;. I was spurred into reading around the DC lore, and by
the time I was done, I understood that the &lt;em&gt;New 52&lt;/em&gt; reality included things
like The Justice League's alternate roster, the early death of Clark's parents,
which distances Superman from humanity and changes the character dramatically,
the loss of the Justice Society of America from Earth, and the loss of Wally
West's Flash. All these and more are written off as the effects of Dr
Manhattan's meddling, isolated and preserved in just another spun-off part of
the multiverse, while being jettisoned from the privileged &lt;em&gt;metaverse&lt;/em&gt;, the
core template from which all subsequent multiversal threads are forged, as it
reverts to more-or-less its former state when Manhattan's changes are undone
during &lt;em&gt;Doomsday Clock&lt;/em&gt;'s story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doing all this, Manhattan exhibits his usual clinical detachment from the
human consequences of his actions, setting himself up as the villain of the
piece, an uncaring "being of inaction", in contrast to Superman, the literal
"man of Action".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt="Doomsday Clock: Superman &amp;amp; Manhattan" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/doomsday-clock-superman.webp"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This forms a genuine riposte to &lt;em&gt;Watchmen's&lt;/em&gt; criticism of the superhero genre.
Yes, the DC heroes inhabit a simpler world, but the simplicity serves a purpose.
Escaping the mundane enhances the mythological power of what they represent as
symbols. Particularly the value of &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt;, as personified by Superman, which,
although possibly somewhat overwrought in the telling - quite literally, in
this tale - makes all other things possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was especially pleased with the quiet, understated places Doomsday Clock goes
with &lt;em&gt;Mothman's&lt;/em&gt;, back-story. The character in &lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt; was only a punchline,
a recurring throwaway reference to instability and alcoholism, telegraphing his
subsequent mental breakdown. But here, we see him fully fleshed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the rest of the &lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt; heroes, he has no magical superhuman powers,
but is still able to pull off entirely unexpected and superhuman-seeming
stunts, merely by the virtue of his own unique kind of extreme mental and
emotional resourcefulness. Flawed, but aware of his faults, and able to pull it
together when he needs to, he befriends the younger Rorschach II during their
overlapping stays in a mental institution, becoming a beacon of warmth,
kindness, and generosity to the younger man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He acts as a symbol, if you will, that just as &lt;em&gt;Watchmen's&lt;/em&gt; ruthless gaze
influenced the wider world of comics, so the comic world gazes back. They see
us, all the real-world, fully-rounded humans, trapped in the depths of our
pathos, and they wonder, when will each of us learn to transcend our humdrum
limitations, to finally act on our hopes and dreams, and &lt;em&gt;fly...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Neuromancer cover" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/neuromancer-cover.webp"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by William Gibson, 1984.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So opens William Gibson's debut novel, and it is to his eternal credit that we
all still remember the line now, nearly forty years later. I don't usually do
audiobooks, but I made an exception for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bartender’s smile widened. His ugliness was the stuff of legend. In an
age of affordable beauty, there was something heraldic about his lack of it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the majority of the beloved science fiction of my youth, Gibson's
poetic, literary style has only increased in my estimation over the subsequent
decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of
legitimate operators, in every nation. By children, being taught mathematical
concepts. A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every
computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged
in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city
lights, receding.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consensual hallucination might seem prosaic now, but one has to remember
this was written back when the internet connected less than 1,000 hosts,
accessed via green screen text terminals on university campuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He'd made the classic mistake, the one he'd sworn he'd never make. He stole
from his employers. [...] Of course he was welcome, they told him, welcome
to the money. And he was going to need it. Because — still smiling
— they were going to make sure he never worked again. They damaged his
nervous system with a wartime Russian mycotoxin. Strapped to a bed in a
Memphis hotel, his talent burning out micron by micron, he hallucinated for
thirty hours. The damage was minute, subtle, and utterly effective. For Case,
who lived for the bodiless exultation of cyberspace, it was the Fall. In the
bars he'd frequented as a cowboy hotshot, the elite stance involved a certain
relaxed contempt for the flesh. The body was meat. Case fell into the prison
of his own flesh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He introduced the world to cyberpunk, combining the fatalistic noire of Blade
Runner with the relentless dehumanizing advances of a libertarian tech
dystopia, to create a startlingly original warning of our possible future that
looks, as the decades tumble by, increasingly on-the-nose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A year here and he still dreamed of cyberspace, hope fading nightly. All the
speed he took, all the turns he'd taken and the corners he cut in Night City,
and he'd still see the matrix in his dreams, bright lattices of logic
unfolding across that colourless void... The Sprawl was a long, strange way
home now over the Pacific, and he was no console man, no cyberspace cowboy.
Just another hustler, trying to make it through. But the dreams came on in
the Japanese night like livewire voodoo, and he'd cry for it, cry in his
sleep, and wake alone in the dark, curled in his capsule in some coffin
hotel, hands clawed into the bedslab, temper foam bunched between his
fingers, trying to reach the console that wasn't there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several versions of Neuromancer as an audiobook. The slightly
abridged six-hour version &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/NeuromancerReadByWilliamGibson"&gt;available for free at the Internet
Archive&lt;/a&gt; is notable
for two things: it is read by William Gibson himself, and it is an extremely
low quality rip from an audiocassette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Night City wasn’t there for its inhabitants, but as a deliberately
unsupervised playground for technology itself. Like a deranged experiment in
social Darwinism, designed by a bored researcher who kept one thumb
permanently on the fast-forward button. Biz here was a constant subliminal
hum, and death the accepted punishment for laziness, carelessness, lack of
grace, failure to heed the demands of an intricate protocol.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audio quality might make anyone immediately pass this version by. It isn't
just noisy, but features discernible wow and flutter - artifacts characteristic
of the stretching or uneven speed of its original tape based media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He closed his eyes. Found the ridged face of the power stud. And in the
bloodlit dark behind his eyes, silver phosphenes boiled in from the edge of
space, hypnagogic images jerking past like a film compiled of random frames.
Symbols, figures, faces, a blurred, fragmented mandala of visual information.
Please, he prayed, now- A gray disk, the color of Chiba sky. Now- Disk
beginning to rotate, faster, becoming a sphere of paler gray. Expanding- And
flowed, flowered for him, fluid neon origami trick, the unfolding of
distanceless home, his country, transparent 3D chessboard extending to
infinity. Inner eye opening to the stepped scarlet pyramid of the Eastern
Seaboard Fission Authority burning beyond the green cubes of Mitsubishi Bank
of America, and high and very far away he saw the spiral arms of the military
systems, forever beyond his reach. And somewhere he was laughing, in a
white-painted loft, distant fingers caressing the deck, tears of release
streaking his face.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I'd urge you to stick with it. For the author's reedy, Virginia-inflected
voice has a cadence that holds the attention. A rhythm of tone and emphasis
that, for me, works considerably better than the practiced glossiness of more
recent, more professional recordings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The moment, I mean the nanosecond, that one of those things starts figuring
out ways to make itself smarter, Turing’ll wipe it. Nobody trusts those
fuckers, you know that. Every AI ever built has an electromagnetic shotgun
wired to its forehead."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the second chapter, I'd stopped being bothered by the audio
quality, and by chapter three, it had become an intrinsic part of the
experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was disturbing to think of the Flatline as a construct, a hardwired ROM
cassette replicating a dead man's skills, obsessions, kneejerk responses.&lt;br&gt;
[...]&lt;br&gt;
He slotted some ice, connected the construct, and jacked in.
It was exactly the sensation of someone reading over his shoulder.
He coughed.&lt;br&gt;
  "Dix? McCoy? That you man?' His throat was tight.&lt;br&gt;
"Hey, bro," said a directionless voice.&lt;br&gt;
"It's Case, man. Remember?"&lt;br&gt;
"Miami, joeboy, quick study."&lt;br&gt;
"What's the last thing you remember before I spoke to you, Dix?"&lt;br&gt;
"Nothin'."&lt;br&gt;
"Hang on." He disconnected the construct. The presence was gone. He reconnected it. "Dix? Who am I?"&lt;br&gt;
"You got me hung, Jack. Who the fuck are you?"&lt;br&gt;
"Remember being here, a second ago?"&lt;br&gt;
"No."&lt;br&gt;
"Know how a ROM personality matrix works?"&lt;br&gt;
"Sure, bro, it's a firmware construct."&lt;br&gt;
"So I jack it into the bank I'm using, I can give it sequential, real time memory?"&lt;br&gt;
"Guess so," said the construct.&lt;br&gt;
"Okay, Dix. You &lt;b&gt;are&lt;/b&gt; a ROM construct. Got me?"&lt;br&gt;
"If you say so," said the construct. "Who are you?"&lt;br&gt;
"Case."&lt;br&gt;
"Miami," said the voice, "joeboy, quick study."&lt;br&gt;
"Right. And for starts, Dix, you and me, we're gonna sleaze over to London grid and access a little data. You game for that?"&lt;br&gt;
"You gonna tell me I got a choice, boy?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A distortion so thoroughly appropriate to the underlying material
it was as though Gibson had planned it this way all along, speaking directly to
me via a weak signal, projected through time by the noisy filters of this
obsolete electro-mechanical recording mechanism. The words at once clear and
irrevocably decayed, fuzzy sounding but still stark and unmistakable in their
meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Dixie?"&lt;br&gt;
"Yeah."&lt;br&gt;
"You ever try to crack an AI?"&lt;br&gt;
"Sure. I flatlined. First time. I was larkin', jacked up real high, out by Rio heavy commerce sector. Big biz, multinationals, Government of Brazil lit up like a Christmas tree. Just larkin' around, you know? And then I started picking up on this one cube, maybe three levels higher up. Jacked up there and made a pass."&lt;br&gt;
"What did it look like, the visual?"&lt;br&gt;
"White cube."&lt;br&gt;
"How'd you know it was an AI?"&lt;br&gt;
"How'd I know? Jesus. It was the densest ice I'd ever seen. So what else was it? The military down there don't have any thing like that. Anyway, I jacked out and told my computer to look it up."&lt;br&gt;
"Yeah?"&lt;br&gt;
"It was on the Turing Registry. AI. Frog company owned its Rio mainframe."&lt;br&gt;
Case chewed his lower lip and gazed out across the plateaus of the Eastern Seaboard Fission Authority, into the infinite neuroelectronic void of the matrix. "Tessier-Ashpool, Dixie?"&lt;br&gt;
"Tessier, yeah."&lt;br&gt;
"And you went back?"&lt;br&gt;
"Sure. I was crazy. Figured I'd try to cut it. Hit the first strata and that's all she wrote. My joeboy smelled the skin frying and pulled the trodes off me. Mean shit, that ice."&lt;br&gt;
"And your EEG was flat."&lt;br&gt;
"Well, that's the stuff of legend, ain't it?'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five out of five stars. A riveting performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Released on PlayStation 3 by thatgamecompany in 2012. Played on Windows 10 in
2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slow-paced opening scenes, alternately trudging up and then surfing down
sunbaked desert dunes, failed to sustain Zander's interest, so I ended up
playing through its short runtime by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways it's an indictment of videogame culture that ten years later it
still feels so fresh and radical to pair players up with another internet
rando, while giving them no means to communicate or interact other than helping
each other out, either leading by example, or exchanging wordless shouts. It
seems like a pretty limited repertoire at first. I'm half tempted to just wander
off ahead, alone, into the endless desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, you realize that standing close enough together recharges each other's
magical flying scarves. Suddenly, it's enough. You cling to each other for dear
life through the howling storms, double back to rescue each other from prowling
beasts, and then fly exuberantly above the sunlit clouds, forever curving back
to seek each other's life-giving sustenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know who the two internet randos were, with whom I shared the first and
second halves of my journey. But in those minutes together, we lived a
lifetime's worth.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>completed</category><category>geek</category><category>media</category><category>videogame</category><category>windows</category><guid>https://tartley.com/posts/journey/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 11:22:20 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Expanse</title><link>https://tartley.com/posts/the-expanse/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The Expanse screencap" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/the-expanse-screencap.webp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This post rescues content from
&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/mfoord/posts/10158389841835880?comment_id=10158390351245880I"&gt;a Facebook comment&lt;/a&gt; I got carried away with recently.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's so much to write about the Expanse. It's such a relief to find a
science fiction show with an ambitiously futuristic setting depicted in a way
that doesn't make scientifically literate people cringe and shout at the
television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it shines at taking the time for quiet moments of character work, from
Miller's lonely, poignant realization in s01 that he wasn't the talented
office maverick, just incompetent and unreliable, right up to the quiet,
unseen payoff of Naomi's years-long efforts to save her son from his father's
influence, in the final seconds of s06.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On many axes, it's the best SF on television, which is saying something, as
there are so many competitors. Science fiction output is following some sort
of Moore's law of endless expansion, in response to society's need for
mythic stories of relevance to modern life, itself a symptom of the meaning
crisis of modern society. But this is a mixed blessing, because the resulting
shows &amp;amp; movies are often drawn to using the superficial trappings of science
fiction, spaceships and lasers (pew pew!), while failing to fulfil the deeper
psychological needs of mythical or symbolic significance that brought about
their creation. The Expanse is perhaps the prime example of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tartley.com/posts/the-expanse/damiengwalter.com"&gt;My fantastic SF podcast guy&lt;/a&gt; defines SF as the arena in
which we forge new myths of psychological meaning for modern life, which are
sorely needed as traditional myths dwindle in relevance, as they are
predominantly based on nature and superstition. Movements such as spiritual
atheism are a reflection that even the least spiritual amongst us recognize
that something is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do concede that defining SF in this way is a bit of a cheat. It's somewhat
aggrandizing, claiming any great mythic work as actually being part of the
SF genre, an no doubt is a somewhat defensive reaction to mainstream
dismissal of science fiction as puerile. But it does provide a marvellous
framework for discussion, and adopting this definition makes several
previously puzzling things fall into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It settles the revealing, never-ending debates over which works are, and
are not, science fiction. Somewhat tellingly, to me, such debates are
irreconcilable precisely because of the misnomer "science fiction", which was
never really about the science to begin with, as this style of fiction has
existed long before science was the focus. It only gravitated towards using
science as it became apparent that is now where society's power and
transformation springs from - our incarnation of gods and magic - and the name
"science fiction" was then applied post-facto, missing the underlying fact
that this is just mythic fiction with some modern attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This definition perfectly explains things like how the first half of the movie
"Sunshine" could be such astonishing science-fiction, while the second half
- set aboard the exact same spaceship - is just a mediocre slasher flick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. SF is the arena within which we construct new mythic narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this I mean that great science fiction tends to create a story that
resonates because it leans on powerful mythic tropes - symbolic
representations of psychological significance, character arcs mirroring
Jungian archetypes, thematic elements that are told allegorically, suggesting
things to the reader/watcher on a level that can be more powerful than merely
stating them directly to the conscious mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, all-time-great examples such as &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; (the
title being conscious of this mythic entanglement) leans heavily into themes
such as humanity watched over by an ancient, mysterious, godlike alien
influence which has literally created humanity in its present form, and
observes as we now reach a second inflection point, materializing not
just a tale of personal transcendence (although it is certainly that), but one
of species-wide sublimation - suggesting that it is time for us all to reach
spiritual adulthood, to graduate to whatever comes next, to meet and be
transformed by the wise and powerful force that has shepherded humanity
through our previous prehistorical transitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on with similar examples, but will just briefly mention the original
Matrix movie, which is a story which resonates because it is absolutely soaked
in allegory of both religious transcendence and Jungian archetypes - which are
so on-the-nose that it cannot possibly be accidental, a fact acknowledged
directly by the creators in the sequels, when they depict the Architect,
ultimate villain encountered at the narrative peak of the story, as a prim,
middle aged, white bearded gentleman, wearing an Edwardian suit. He speaks in a
precise, almost Germanic manner. This is, unmistakably, Sigmund Freud. Why is
Freud the villain of the Matrix? Because Freud was a contemporaneous antagonist
to Jung, resisting Jung's ideas of self actualization through reconciliation of
the archetypes, just as the Architect resists Neo's progression along that same
path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be my own lack of imagination, but compared to examples like this, the
Expanse starts to look a bit thin. I don't see any symbolism or allegory.
There is some good character work but no actual arcs of transcendence. Through
the unfortunate realities of converting books to screen, large chunks of what
could have been the most meaningful story were simply abandoned and will
apparently never be finished on the screen. In their stead, what would have
been mythic elements become a series of "McGuffin of the week", as we never
circle back to resolve why the protomolecule was created, why it was sent to
our ancient solar system, why it turns people into nuclear-powered zombies,
and what force destroyed the protomolecule creators, and why? And that's just
series one's unresolved elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, lacking that, what the Expanse has to offer is its superlative
world-building and sane, believable depictions of a gritty interplanetary
future. Which is no small feat - arguably nobody else has done it better. But,
for me, it isn't enough. Maybe that's just because I'm a godless heathen who
looks to get my spiritual fix through TV shows about spaceships. Or maybe it's
because science fiction is where we show ourselves what we're capable of, what
to aim for, and I believe we can aim higher than just exciting technological
dystopias.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>fiction</category><category>media</category><category>science-fiction</category><category>tv</category><guid>https://tartley.com/posts/the-expanse/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2022 19:42:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://tartley.com/posts/contact/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float: left"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Carl Sagan, 1985.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put this into my library queue as it's highly regarded in some parts, and I'd
never read it. But at about chapter 2, I started to realize that I actually
have read it, maybe thirty years ago. Not only that, but I'm pretty sure I
actually have a copy somewhere on the shelves here at home. I'm going senile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well, at least it's the sort of senile that gives me quick, pleasant things
to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also this month: &lt;em&gt;The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet&lt;/em&gt; by Becky Chambers.
Once again, I wanted to like this so much. I started reading it twice, spaced
about 18 months apart. But each time, I just couldn't get into it, and
abandoned it about 1/3 in. It is indubitably me, not you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Genevieve Gornichec, 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old Norse mythology only briefly mentions the witch
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angrbo%C3%B0a"&gt;Angrboða&lt;/a&gt;,
as the mother of three "monsters", fathered by the trickster god, Loki. This
book explores her life, explicitly acknowledging her erasure as a woman, and
resolves it, providing her a powerful story, in which she survives men, gods,
and all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another fantastic Suze recommendation. Loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also this month: &lt;em&gt;The Emperess of Salt and Fortune&lt;/em&gt; by Nghi Vo. I wanted to
like this sooo much, and can see so many things about that are wonderful, but
for some reason I just couldn't get in the mood. The problem is indubitably me,
not you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Circe cover" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/circe-cover.webp"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Madeline Miller, 2018.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommended by The Suze, after reading it for one of her book clubs,
and I absolutely loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tells the life story of the mythical Circe of the ancient Greek pantheon.
Daughter of Helios, mightiest of the Titans, Circe is driven from her family by
their capricious cruelty. She puts her meagre supernatural talents to work in
service of witchcraft, amongst mortals. Along the way she meets many well-known
mythological characters, such as Odysseus, and the Cretean Minotaur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the writing style that captivated me. A timeless, elegant style uses
powerful turns of phrase to spin a tale of drama and high passions, soaked
in the psychological resonances so typical of Greek mythology.
This style, along with the setting, reminded me powerfully of another favourite
couple of novels of recent years, Mary Renault's absolutely fabulous &lt;em&gt;The King
Must Die&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Bull From the Sea&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circe is my favorite book of the year so far, beating out even the marvellous
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://tartley.com/posts/klara-and-the-sun"&gt;Klara and the Sun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
