&lt;a href="https://www.tartley.com/posts/termination-shock"&gt;named Neal Stephenson as the author I'd read more of&lt;/a&gt;
than any other. But I was forgetting about being young and inhaling books.
On reflection, that title must surely belong to Larry Niven. As a teenager I
read every last thing he did - or at least everything I could find in my
hometown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point my Mom picked up &lt;em&gt;World Out of Time&lt;/em&gt;, to see what craziness her
son was always buried in, and she concluded over the dinner table that I was
reading it for the sex scenes she'd found. I presumably objected inarticulately
that I was so little interested in Larry Niven's brief depictions of space sex
that I'd barely even noticed they were there, but I have the impression she
wasn't convinced. But it &lt;em&gt;really was&lt;/em&gt; was his brand of hard science fiction
that I was there for (I protest too much!) - revolving around ideas rather than
character arcs, and the ruthless application of consistent world-views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In inventing the Ringworld, Niven was inspired by Dyson spheres,
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Maker"&gt;first described by Olaf Stapledon&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140109033551/http://meaningoflife.tv/transcript.php?speaker=dyson"&gt;popularized by Freeman Dyson&lt;/a&gt;.
A full, solid Dyson sphere was, in some regards, inefficient. Dyson postulated
miraculous gravity generators to make the inner surface of the sphere
habitable. But this can be achieved much more feasibly by simply spinning the
structure. However, all the matter inside the sphere, including any atmosphere,
then pools at the equator. Niven observed that the superfluous surface of the
sphere, away from the equator, can then be removed, given a suitable "wall"
along each edge to keep the fringes of the atmosphere in - say 1,000km high.
This vastly reduces the material needed to construct the megastructure. You
would easily have enough from recycling all the planets in a solar system as
building material, given miraculous elemental transmutation, while still
providing a habitable interior surface something like a million time larger
than planet Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aliens themselves weren't quite like any I've read before or since. The
creepy sessile but sentient Grogs. The mysterious Outsiders, information
brokers who are able to answer any question humanity has - if only we could
afford the price. The warlike, carnivorous Kzin (surely an inspiration for
Wing Commander's Kilrathi) - picture a species of vicious Chewbaccas, forever
attacking humanity before they were ready. You can't help but almost feel sorry
for them. By the times of Ringworld, representatives such as Speaker to Animals
(named for his profession, interfacing with humans) are sufficiently adapted to
working alongside humans to become formidable allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Niven's greatest alien race was The Pierson's Puppeteers - like an
ostrich with two necks, each topped with a single eye and dexterous mouth,
while the brain resides safely in the body (pictured below, on the cover for
Neutron star). The body plan makes so much sense in action. Mobile eyes mean
they routinely view objects from both sides simultaneously, perfect for
close-up detailed work, using the hand-like mouths. Or, spread the necks wide
for amazing stereoscopic vision when distance estimation matters. And that
gestural laugh - eyes turned inward to briefly gaze into one another, observing
the self, no mirror required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psychology is also exquisite. Herbivores and herd-beasts, the Puppeteers
are inveterate cowards. No human has ever met a sane one - only their more
unstable individuals would venture out alone to run the risks of space travel
and meeting alien species. However, they are very intelligent, more so than
humans, and industrious, and manipulative. It becomes clear over the course of
the books that Puppeteers have selectively bred the Kzin into constructive
docility by engineering the many human-kzin wars, and their plans for everyone
else are scarcely less manipulative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, my personal favorite was always the Pak. As alien as could be, and yet
they are us. On humanity's original homeworld, long before introduction to
planet Earth, a symbiotic plant grows which young humans find uninteresting,
but in middle-age they develop a compulsion to binge on it. It activates genes
that provoke startling physiological and psychological changes, transforming
the human from a &lt;em&gt;breeder&lt;/em&gt;, into a &lt;em&gt;protector&lt;/em&gt; - stronger, and with large
joints for better leverage, with a tough wrinkled armour-like skin, much
smarter, with a second heart, and ruthlessly dedicated to just one goal -
protecting their own offspring. It is protectors who, it turns out many novels
later, originally built the Ringworld. The absence of the transforming plant on
Earth means our breeders grow without its benefits, leaving us with inadequate
hearts, and an old-aged descent into feeble bodies and minds. This is all
prehistorical backdrop. Then, on modern day Earth, an interstellar spaceship
shows up, piloted by one protector, come to rescue the failed colony, with a
hold full of strange plant roots...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wonders like these, from the novels and short stories set in his Known Space
universe kept me up at night, and shaped the way I thought. Although Niven's
writing had some mildly conservative tendencies, especially when under the
influence of his militaristic writing partner Jerry Pournelle, it is also
permeated with the necessity of a very liberal philosophy of non-judgemental
tolerance of alien lifestyles, a philosophy made explicit in one of &lt;em&gt;Niven's
Laws&lt;/em&gt;: "The only universal message in science fiction: There exist minds that
think as well as you do, but differently."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's clear I wasn't the only one spellbound. Niven's ideas have been
influential throughout science fiction culture. Bank's Culture's Orbitals and
the understandably much rarer full Rings are clear descendants, as is the
eponymous megastructure/superweapon of the juggernaut &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; franchise, and
countless other imitators. Niven's meticulous hard-SF approach to fantasy in
&lt;em&gt;The Magic Goes Away&lt;/em&gt;, and in particular his concept of the conservation of
&lt;em&gt;mana&lt;/em&gt;, was an influence on &lt;em&gt;Magic: The Gathering&lt;/em&gt;, as acknowledged in the card
Nevinyrral's Disk (Niven's name backwards), which uses magic to simultaneously
accelerate it's own spin, and to hold itself together, thus rapidly using up
all the mana in an area, rendering further magic unusable. Movies such as
Wall-E throw in sly nods - the Axiom is labelled in a passing graphic as using
a "General Dynamics Type Three Hull", which is a similar size and shape to
Niven's "General Products Number Three Hull".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years I remember toting Niven's various doorstop 500 page novels to one
place or another, such as being forbidden from carrying one into the Houses of
Parliament viewing gallery. All the better that they usually had these crazy
great '70s covers, mostly by artist
&lt;a href="http://www.peterandrewjones.net/iacg.htm"&gt;Peter Andrew Jones&lt;/a&gt;,
from whom you can buy prints of some of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collecting these today by Google image search, I see today that these funky
covers are relatively rare - the vast majority of Niven's sales were of
editions with far less interesting and less skillfully put together covers. So
I think it's appropriate to highlight and celebrate them here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="clear: both"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've not even read half of what Niven wrote. By the '90s the crazy covers had
been replaced by more conservative designs, and at the same time I drifted away
to other things. At the time it felt more like Niven was drifting away from me,
evolving in style over the years, losing something hard-to-characterize that
I'd enjoyed, maybe just the rawness of his earlier works. Maybe his style was
diluted through him writing so many books as partnerships, or, as I
increasingly assumed, in an advisory role, lending his name to the cover for
younger, less well-known authors, who did most of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, while the affair lasted, it was fabulous. Goodreads page counts
indicates it was eleven thousand pages, beating my Neal Stephenson consumption
by a clear thousand pages. Combining that with a very conservative estimate of
the number of times I re-read each one, nearly twenty five thousand pages. What
can I say, I was a teenager, with seemingly endless oceans of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are just his books that I've read. He has many others, especially
many that are more recent than these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Termination Shock cover" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2022/termination-shock-cover.webp"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Neal Stephenson, 2021&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's another 720-page doorstop from the much-beloved author (which is actually
slightly slimmer than his average book, which would be 770 pages). It was
enjoyable, but not life changing. Not as compelling as some of his previous.
Reads a lot like a narrative wrapped around the author's own personal
justifications for pro-active geo-engineering projects. Which, I have to admit,
I was pretty horrified by the idea when I first heard about it - meddling
further with a critical and horrifically complex dynamic system that we don't
undertand, and all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story presents the the scenario of countering the temperature rise caused
by CO2 in the atmosphere by releasing high altitude sulphur dioxide, to reflect
sunlight back into space. This mitigates many of the most prominent effects of
climate change, such as high-temperatures, storms, forest fires, and sea-level
rises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It further presents the idea that it's relatively easy and cheap to do, and
some nation or part thereof that cares the most - e.g. The Netherlands, or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venice, amongst others, will either take a crack at it, or else will cease to
exist. So we might as well get used to the idea and be prepared for what,
geopolitically, happens after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know if it's simply the story making me increasingly familiar with the
idea, or whether the depiction of the mechanism genuinely quells some of my
worries, in that it seems easy to start at a small scale, monitor the results,
scale up as required, and the fail-safe is that the sulphur should quickly fall
out of the air, allegedly harmlessly, if we realize this was a bad idea. I've
at least tempered my initial harshly negative viewpoint somewhat. So, mission
accomplished, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've probably read more text by Stephenson than any other writer. Hmmm. By

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Alejandro Jodorowsky, art by Jean Giraud (aka MÅbius), 1980-88&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grabbed this in the English translation from the original French, having been
intrigued by the &lt;em&gt;Pocket Essential Alan Moore&lt;/em&gt;'s description of it as a
contender for "the best comic in the medium's history".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creative pairing also worked together on
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodorowsky%27s_Dune"&gt;the unproduced 1970s movie of Dune&lt;/a&gt;,
the one whose cast was to have included Salvador DalÃ­, Orson Welles,
Gloria Swanson, and Mick Jagger, and presumably would have been pretty trippy -
I mean, &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt; trippy than the David Lynch one turned out to be. The
artist, MÅbius, has had a long and glorious career, knighted for his art in his
native France, and he worked on other movies such as Alien, Tron, The Fifth
Element, and The Abyss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Echoes of all of these are visible throughout the consistently stunning
artwork of The Incal, and it has been explicitly noted as an influence on the
expansive decayed futurescapes of Akira and Blade Runner, and the flamboyant
visuals of the Star Wars prequels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writing really swings for the fences, a sprawling tale of a reluctant
hero's journey, taking in societal commentary, intergalactic travel, spiritual
transformation, iconic incarnations of good and evil, and a deep thread of
mysticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, it does have a very evident "foreign" feeling - small social nuances
with which I'm unfamiliar. Equally clearly, this is part of its exotic charm.
And while the story touches on, perhaps even consists of, deep themes, it
doesn't so much articulately explore them, but instead simply incorporates
them. This is not a comic for people who are not already comic fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lesser hands, it might have been undisciplined. But wherever the story
roams, the artwork is endlessly enthralling. I especially liked the touch of
protagonist, John DiFool, starting out distinctly ugly, but being rendered more
handsomely on the rare occasions he manages to get in touch with his more noble
aspects. Jodorowsky manages to keep it all together, bringing it around to a
splendidly satisfying theatrical close. &lt;em&gt;Bravo!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Klara and the Sun cover" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2022/klara-and-the-sun-cover.webp"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Kazuo Ishiguro, 2021&lt;/em&gt; &lt;img alt="spoilers" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/spoilers.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was just wonderful to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The near-future scenario is revealed in a compellingly minimal way, teased
in minor details. Eventually we piece together an epidemic of children without
siblings, born into a competitive, authoritarian society. Higher-rank parents
are able to purchase artificial friends, to help with the rigors of
socialization. Klara, a newly activated artificial friend, demonstrates a lack
of experience in dealing with human situations, but her efforts are
unstinting, to understand what is going on within the family to whom she is
sold, and do her best for them. Her earnest naivety as a narrator only
serves to magnify the emotional impacts of the story, as her keen but
inexperienced observation conveys everything we need to know about the
dysfunctions of her tragic new family. She describes
herself as feeling emotions, so the story is partly a discussion of what it
means to be concious, to feel, as the humans around her are forced by
circumstance into desperate schemes that expose the self-protective
aspects of their love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all that, though, I'm not sure what to take away from it. Clearly the
author is very skilled. It seems likely that metaphors are at work here. But,
lunk that I am, I'm unable to discern what they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm fairly sure that the "boxes" Klara sometimes relates her perceptions being
divided into are just stylish flair - a reference to the ways in which her
brain works differently from ours, calving off processing into separate
processors, or some-such, which comes to the fore when she is under stress,
or deciphering complex emotions. I don't &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; this strikingly non-literal
aspect is indicative of any deeper symbolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when I fail to pick up on metaphor, it's because religious
allegory is involved. Beyond tales of mere personal transcendence, my brain
just isn't wired that way. I can see that Klara is in many ways an innocent.
Free not only of wrongdoing, but also of wishing harm, and - being made, not
born - of original sin. On the literal level, this is emotionally
resonant, especially when Klara's heroic contribution to the family is
rewarded by being uncomplainingly discarded, like an appliance, at the end of
the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is this related to the other big clue about things I'm not picking up on -
the title? I'm at a loss of what to make about Klara's relationship with the
sun, which is a central plot point. Was Klara's bargain with her Sun god
literally answered by a special burst of healing light, that saved her family's
child from terminal illness? Certainly that is how Klara relates it. Could she
perhaps have been imagining this? Might the recovery have been fated to happen
anyway, and Klara's association with the burst of sunlight was all in her head?
But the text tells us that the rest of the household are awestruck by the
brilliance and beauty of that particular sunbeam, not just Klara. Later on, the
questions Rick asks of Klara show that, although he does not understand, he has
guessed the significance of the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. Klara the innocent's anthropomorphized Sun god's healing powers are real,
and He answers her prayers to save the life of a child. And I don't know what
to make of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I'm in good company. A quick search does yield intelligent writing
about the book, but I don't see anyone coming up with aspects or metaphors
that I've entirely overlooked - although that is usually quite fruitful when I
search about other books that puzzle me. So I venture that I'm not the only one
who doesn't get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Starship Troopers cover" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2021/starship-troopers-cover.webp"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Robert Heinlein, 1959.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first time reading this classic old Hugo winner. I'd seen the 1995 movie
many years ago, which is clearly a satire, highlighting the fascistic
tendencies of the dedicated military discipline required for humanity to
survive in a dog-eat-dog galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But was that Heinlein's original intent? I don't detect that in my reading of
it. The text seems, to my eyes, to be a straight-up endorsement and
glorification of military discipline, corporal and capital punishment, and
withholding citizenship from people who haven't served in the military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen people argue that, as an expert writer, Heinlein knew precisely what
he was doing, and didn't need to draw attention to his critiques of fascism in
order for an astute reader to realize that not everything espoused by the novel
is necessarily good, or corresponds with the author's viewpoint. We are still
discussing the novel 60 years later, and its relationship to fascism, so he has
achieved his goal of getting us to think about it. After all, didn't Heinlein
write this partway through his drafting of what would become &lt;em&gt;Stranger in a
Strange Land&lt;/em&gt;, which features hippy sexual freedom, and &lt;em&gt;Troopers&lt;/em&gt; itself
contains nods to racial and gender equality (albeit these are somewhat
ham-fisted.) Hence, say some, Heinlein was would not genuinely have intended to
advocate militaristic or fascist views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not convinced. It seems entirely possible that Heinlein was in favor of
sexual freedoms, while in other regards advocating staunch militarism. He
wrote &lt;em&gt;Troopers&lt;/em&gt; directly in response to the US suspending nuclear weapons
testing, which he wished to see resume. According to Wikipedia he stated at the
time that he used the novel to clarify his military and political views, such
as that the USA was too conciliatory in its dealings with China and the Soviet
Union. In the book, the "bugs" - alien enemies, are explicitly referred to as
communist, and depicted as mostly mindless drones, for which the only solution
is eradication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. I don't agree with the author's outlook, and wasn't convinced by the book's
interpretation of civics, and passages of moralizing. But it was an
interesting, albeit naturally dated, read, to see what successful military
SF looked like 60 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a marvellous literary romp, deploying the tropes and language of science
fiction to deliver a scintillatingly poetic payload of â dare I say it â
credible romance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combatants in the Time War seek to bring about historical outcomes which
predispose those futures which will result in the generation of their own
particular civilisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one future, humans have embraced machine-oriented augmentation, uploads,
and all that that implies. In the other, transformation is wrought by
biological means, accepting humankind's role as a part of a natural ecosystem,
boostrapping the whole to greatness by a ruthless application of evolutionary
principles. Each finds the other repulsive, and their existence is mutually
exclusive. From our perspective, they appear equally awe-inspiring and terrible
to behold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as intriguing as all that is, it's not why we're here. Instead we get
the much more personal accounts of two omni-capable antagonists on the front
lines. Theirs is a subtle art, weaving probabilities of lasting change through
very human interventions - as well as wading knee deep in the dead when
occasion demands it, to tip the scales of pivotal battles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding each other with wariness and respect, from across the gulf of
realities, they battle up the threads and down the braids of innumerable
possible pasts and futures. Until they begin sending what can only be
characterized as &lt;em&gt;letters&lt;/em&gt; to each other, albeit often encoded in startlingly
â poetically â obscure ways, so as to remain secret from their enemies and
their masters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around these letters are formed the novel's tight, alternating structure,
reminding me of Bank's &lt;em&gt;Use of Weapons&lt;/em&gt;. Before you know it, their respect for
each other's skills has grown to full-blown giddy all-out love. But where to,
from there? Their communications to date are already traitorous - grounds for
terminal repercussions. Nowhen in the multiverse are they safe from their
respective commanders. Losing the time war would mean they no longer â had
never â existed. Winning the time war would mean the same for their opposite
number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At which point, the novel cleverly folds back on itself - these are consummate
masters of time, and subtle but decisive influence, after all - to perform an
act of escapology, hinting to us that all their previous acts and letters could
be re-construed as having left a trail, ready to be exploited once the moment
was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a long way from my usual preference of hard-as-nails SF, but I loved it
nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Adrian Tchaikovsky (2015)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of people love this, and it was jolly enough, but it just isn't for me. A
couple of times I toyed with the idea of invoking my new policy of abandoning
any book that isn't absolutely knocking my socks off - something I haven't
previously been in the habit of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unfair of me to compare one book with another, but partly, I was irked by
featuring an alien planet of spiders, that being so reminiscent of Vernor
Vinge's 1999 novel &lt;em&gt;A Deepness in the Sky&lt;/em&gt; (and he can hardly be the first to
play with that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, Tchaikovsky's spider civilization definitely exhibits more
thought-out arachnid sensibilities, whereas Vinge's act more like a Dickensian
family drama - "Button up warm, childlings!" "Yes, Daddy!". But Vinge was there
first, and has such a high profile, being a sequel to a much-loved Hugo winner,
that it casts a shadow on anything else following on the same path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partly, also, I've been spoiled by hard science fiction from people like
Peter Watts - real scientists, who are devastatingly smart, and are not afraid
to dazzle their readers with it, even if that makes it a little hard going at
times. Something about Children of Time was just too easygoing for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="The Buried Giant cover" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2021/the-buried-giant-cover.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Kazuo Ishiguro, 2015&lt;/em&gt; &lt;img alt="spoilers" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/spoilers.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mythical tale, set in post-Arthurian England. Author Kazuo Ishiguro, Nobel
prize winner for literature, is also famous for Klara and the Sun, Never Let
Me Go, and The Remains of the Day (yes, that one about butlers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishiguro moved from Japan to England as a young child, and his insightful
observation of English and Western culture and myth benefits from that
transplant's perspective - at once deeply at home in England, and also
an outsider to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tale is populated by ragged peoples, affected by a pervasive amnesia.
Elderly couple Axl and Beatrice abruptly decide to leave their village of damp,
hobbit-like underground burrows to visit a son they'd forgotten they had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simlarly, other characters are inspired by a variety of classical sources, from
Beowulf to Arthur's knight and nephew Sir Gawain, now old and prone to quixotic
rants - hinting at the subconscious conflict his code of honor has with the
dark means by which he and other knights formerly helped Arthur achieve the
current uneasy peace between native Britons and invading Saxons, now occupying
villages across the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey is perilous, encountering roaming ogres and deadly pixies, not
to mention soldiers of the local lords, and deadly conflicts within the party
itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But any action is relayed with cool distance. Either through the pervasive
mental fog, or using expert fighters' clinical analysis of the minutia of
stance or grip, or by foretelling the ebb and flow of a battle by analysing the
terrain, then allowing the battle itself to take place off stage, only assumed
to have happened, by characters who weren't there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This muted indirectness is entirely in keeping with the ambiguous, dreamlike
style of the book, which is heightened by the sing-song formalism of the
characters' medieval speech, and the narrator's occasional surreal hint of
relating this tale to contemporaries who live in some other, unidentifiable,
historic time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey eventually comes to revolve around the dispatch - or defence - of a
dragon that is said to be the source of everyone's forgetfulness, and as this
goal approaches, vague fears surface of what might be remembered when the
mist lifts. Will Axl and Beatrice's treasured relationship survive the
revelations of their pasts? Will the longstanding truce in the land survive
the remembering of wartime battles and atrocities? Will Saxon resentment at
Arthur's desperate misdeeds be stoked into resumption of the violent war of
invasion? This is left unresolved by the novel's end, but as reader, we know
that the Saxons did ultimately conquer all of England, displacing the Britons
culturally and politically, and probably murdering a good number of them along
the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I'm minded to think of ancient England here as being a root of
modern Western culture, and the mist as an allegory for the bland ignorance of
our own culture's atrocities. The deliberate forgetting, like the mist, clouds
all our conciousnesses, making it hard for us to remember who we are. Why we're
here. The silent resentment of crushed minorities and genocide survivors forms
a pressure, struggling against the placating narrative that everything's OK
now. But, contained, the pressure builds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly a buried giant, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="The Glass Bead Game cover" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2021/glass-bead-game-cover.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Hermann Hesse (1943). Translated from German to English with evident
devotion and expertise by Clara Winston &amp;amp; Richard Winston.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;img alt="spoilers" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/spoilers.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This novel is described by some as the culmination of Hesse's career, for
which he received a Nobel Prize for Literature. Many reviews on
&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16634.The_Glass_Bead_Game"&gt;Goodreads&lt;/a&gt;
cite it as a life-changing novel, or as a singular all-time favorite book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must confess with some sadness that I must have entirely missed the point. I
have not enjoyed it &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;. The number of books I failed to finish in my
life is surely less than five, and this very nearly became one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first half describes Knecht's education and career within the rarefied
academic atmosphere of some distant future European state's "pedagogical
province", wherein (exclusively male) scholars devote their time to
mastery of the titular game. This relies upon drawing deep relationships
between all fields of human study, such as music and biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knecht is talented and likeable, and rises effortlessly through the ranks,
without exhibiting any real volition of his own, other than being naturally
predisposed to study, and having an instinct for drawing out the best in
people. He is ultimately assigned to the highest office in the land, without
encountering any substantive antagonist or difficulty along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanics of the game itself, about which all this ostensibly revolves, is
deliberately never explained, other than poetic references to glass beads
being used to exquisitely interrelate insights or concepts from multiple fields
of study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first half of the book bored me to absolute tears. If I had to find a
single word to describe Knecht, despite his diligence, it would be "inactive".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the halfway point through the book, this serenity is interrupted by
Knecht making the controversial decision to quit, not just from his exalted
post, but from the whole system over which it rules. He leaves the insular
academic province entirely, to begin a new life, subject to more real-world
constraints. Just at this very moment, as the narrative becomes interesting,
this section abruptly ends in a very unexpected manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the whole book, this moment resonates with me. Knecht has spent a life
devoted to scholarly thought, but after many decades he throws off the
expectations of that life to forge his own path. Mere days after that decision,
a moment of physical exertion proves to be his sudden undoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this show that Knecht should have more highly valued the protections from
the physical world that his intellectual castle provided? That someone raised
in such a cosseted environment was unsuitable to face the rigors of the real
world? Or should I instead observe that, despite his ostensible success and
satisfaction with life, in waiting so long before daring to strike out on his
own, and then find days later that his time was up, Knecht has in some ways
wasted his life doing something other than what he really wanted to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither of these seem particularly compelling to me, nor sufficient for
the larger themes that I suspect the book might actually be grappling with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second half of the book contains various poems, written by Knecht when he
was younger, containing premonitions of his aspirations and his doubts. It ends
with three short tales, each describing an alternate life that Knecht might
have lived in other times. Apparently early drafts had these tales being
literal other lives Knecht was reincarnated into. But in the published book,
they are presented without context, and I think it is only by consensus
that they are commonly understood to be grouped with the earlier poems as
examples of Knecht's writing - his imagination of other lives he might have
lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not understand the relevance of these tales to the larger portion of
the book, other than the way they forcefully contrast with it, by immersing
Knecht in emotional and painful tales of life embedded within a wider society,
rather than abstractly observing its achievements from without. As such,
they force him into action, and to me they are more engaging for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia informs me that each of the four tales of Knecht's life focuses on a
different basic aspect of analytical psychology: thinking (Magister Ludi),
sensation (The Rainmaker), intuition (Indian life) and feeling (The Father
Confessor). Similarly, several of the book's characters who had influence on
Knecht are thinly-veiled references to real world people, some famous such
as Friedrich Nietzsche, others being acquaintances of the author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of which seems reasonable, but doesn't really help me understand what I
just read. Perhaps each tale of Knecht, in focussing on one human trait,
is lacking because it undervalues the other three. Perhaps.

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Jason Shiga (2016)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm just discovering the works of &lt;a href="http://www.shigabooks.com"&gt;Jason Shiga&lt;/a&gt;,
creator of mathematically-inspired nonlinear comic-books, e.g. stories drawn
on complex origami structures, that can be folded in various ways to represent
either branching story-lines, or else to manage state such as 'inventory'.
Construction of these more elaborate paper constructions doesn't scale,
(ie. I'm not likely to ever own one) but you can try some of his other
creations on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href="http://www.shigabooks.com/index.php?page=001"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt;,
a regular linear web-comic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storyline is 'math-inspired' too, in the same way that the movie &lt;em&gt;Primer&lt;/em&gt;
is - intense, absolute, ruthless, narrative exploration of logical
implications, while continually, dizzyingly, escalating to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
