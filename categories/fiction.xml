&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by David Foster Wallace (1999)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A collection of creative essays, varying from playful to unflinchingly
uncomfortable, shot through with Wallace's typical humour and
introspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've tended to love and hate his &lt;a href="https://www.tartley.com/infinite-jest"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.tartley.com/everything-and-more"&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; in equal measure, but with such
ferocity that I unreservedly place him amongst my very favourite
authors. There wasn't even much for me to hate in this one, relatively
lacking as it is in labyrinthine footnotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of the essays left me cold (&lt;em&gt;Tri-Stan: I Sold Sissee Nar to
Ecko&lt;/em&gt; springs to mind), but most of them I found thoroughly engaging and
thought provoking. I'm tempted to read up on those that seemed most
challenging to me (&lt;em&gt;Church Not Made With Hands&lt;/em&gt;, say), and give them
another try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a while. Rating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0/10 if you don't want to delve deeply into sometimes uncomfortable
subjects, such as depression, unconventional sex acts, and rape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/10 if you like to be stretched, or at least stirred around, in
interesting directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>books</category><category>fiction</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/2014/1/22/brief-interviews-with-hideous-men/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2014 02:51:51 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Makers</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/2009/4/18/makers/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Cory Doctorow&lt;/em&gt; (not yet published.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://craphound.com/"&gt;Cory&lt;/a&gt; very kindly brought an early manuscript of
this as a gift to &lt;a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www.gilesthomas.com/"&gt;Giles&lt;/a&gt; and I when we met him a while ago,
and I've been wracked with guilt ever since because I apparently lost it
soon after. Thankfully, it recently turned up (on
&lt;a href="http://babbageclunk.com/"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt;'s desk - my fault!) last week, so
I happily finished it pronto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's his best fiction yet! He must be honing his abilities with
practice. \o/ Michael do you want it next?.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian doesn't like my subjectivity-proof rating system, so this one
is specially for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/10 if you want a lightly styled but deeply speculative and engrossing
story that winds a like a sightseeing tour around the social and
personal ramifications of the ways in which modern technology is
changing the way people interact, organise and get things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0/10: If you aren't interested in the ways society is changing under our
feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>books</category><category>fiction</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/2009/4/18/makers/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 18 Apr 2009 22:10:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Infinite Jest</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/2009/3/28/infinite-jest/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Inifinite Jest" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2009/02/infinitejest.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by David Foster Wallace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had such a diverse set of reactions to this, and how could I not?
The writing is bold and idiosyncratic throughout. The novel's story is
not presented in chronological order, and the timeline is obfuscated by
the gleeful adoption of 'subsidised time', in which traditional numeric
monikers denoting each calender year are replaced by the sponsored
labels designated by major corporations - 'Year of the Whopper', and so
on - a marvellous concept which nevertheless makes it completely and
artificially impossible to tell what the hell's going on until about 500
pages in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole novel unashamedly celebrates the author's literary and formal
grammatical credentials - from the extraordinarily-crafted opening
scene, where a tragically misunderstood literary genius disastrously
fails a university entrance interview, with just a hint of a
semi-autobiographical air about him. Scenes of superlative execution are
interspersed with a narrative that is, on the whole, told in the third
person but in the argot of the currently eminent protagonist, leading to
large swathes of the book which are, like, more than conversational in
their familiarity. The combination gives rise to a relentlessly
inventive stream of neology and malapropism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the book resoundingly makes many insightful points by the
conclusion, the story which serves as a vehicle for their delivery is,
at best, a ramshackle collision of ideas, introducing entirely new and
unexplored premises at the 11th hour, and then petering out, ignored and
unresolved, by the final page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insidious footnotes for which Wallace's writings are well-known do
not serve to streamline the prose by separating out incidental
annotations, but instead seem specifically employed to elevate the
reader's awareness of the footnotes themselves. Including them in the
main body of the text would allow for the possibility of a busy reader
failing to give each pithy addendum it's full, weighty consideration.
Wallace cunningly obviates this possibility, by discreetly giving pause
to any reader assiduously trying to do their best with a challenging
book, requiring them to invoke the titillating ritual of thumbing
forward a literal thousand pages or so, giving an involuntary moment of
rest in the narrative in which the reader may properly anticipate the
mysterious text to be revealed while they dereference the footnote's
numeric identifier, and then a second pause afterwards to properly
digest and appreciate, while they thumb a literal thousand pages back
again to find where they left off. Three hundred and eighty eight times,
no less. Plus sub-footnotes, obviously. Some of these are pages-long
tomes of critically insightful dialog between major characters. Many
others are completely irrelevant technical specifications. I have to
ask, what the fuck is going on here? Does this really make the novel
somehow better? While I laughed and cried about the content of many of
the footnotes, I remain unconvinced by the mechanism of their delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rant about these aspects of style because these are definitely the
first impressions any reader will have. Getting into the book &lt;a href="http://kottke.org/09/03/growing-sentences-with-david-foster-wallace"&gt;does
require a little
work&lt;/a&gt;.
But fortunately Wallace more than provides the incentive to do so. The
book ranges over many areas, but is mostly about addiction, in its many
forms, and its relationship to freedom of will and to happiness. These
are deep and interesting topics, and are unflinchingly explored with a
very keen eye. For every one of the annoyances mentioned above, the book
provides powerful rewards for those who stick it out. The
heart-wrenching depictions of people going through the utter destruction
of their humanity are as touching and insightful as anything I have
read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some problems or tasks in life which are small enough that an
individual can overcome them by force of will, grinding down the problem
until it is flattened and overcome. This approach fails, however, when
the problem is too large or too hard. Some problems cannot be crushed by
any individual. To navigate past them requires that, instead of trying
to demolish the problem, the individual must instead mould themselves to
fit around the problem's existing contours. People emerge on the other
side of these experiences triumphant but sober - having been changed to
their core by the experience. I consider &lt;em&gt;Infinite Jest&lt;/em&gt; to belong to
this latter class of experience. From the base-camp of its 981 pages
(plus 98 of footnotes), it is intimidating and uncompromising. You love
it and hate it in equal measure, and it makes no attempt to pander to
the former. But as I ploughed on, through it, week after week after
week, I grew to enjoy it more and more and more. I began to see
reminders of it everywhere I looked. I spotted echoes of its style in
the speech of friends who are fans of Wallace. It began, very subtly, to
infect my own speech and writing. The topics it covered touched me to
the core, changing my outlook on deep issues such as religion. By the
time I reached the very last page I emerged, bruised and weary, but also
tremendously excited - I actually flipped it right back and re-read the
first few chapters all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for perhaps the greatest test to date of my supposedly
subjectivity-proof rating system. Here goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/10: If you are ready for a challenge, that entertains and wrenches in
equal measure, stretching you, changing your definitions, taking you on
a tour of regions you never knew existed. It will make you laugh and it
will make you cry. It will leave you a different person than when you
began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0/10: If you can't be bothered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>books</category><category>fiction</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/2009/3/28/infinite-jest/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 28 Mar 2009 21:26:49 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Catcher in the Rye</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/2008/9/3/the-catcher-in-the-rye/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2008/09/catcher-in-the-rye.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Jerome D. Salinger&lt;/em&gt;, 1951.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, people make such a fuss over it, they really do. You ask
anyone. It's that Salinger's fault. He never listens to anyone.
Sometimes I think he only writes it because he knows it gets on peoples
goat. Writing about some crazy kid. I mean, I say he's crazy because
that's what everyone says, but he's no crazier than the rest of us if
you want to know the truth. Smoking and swearing getting laid, if he got
half a chance. But it's only what anyone would have done, well, anyone
with any sense, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's one thing about it though, it made me remember a time when I was
very young, no joke, and I started reading this very book, I don't know
where I got it, I think my Father gave it to me. But I don't think I got
very far. It must have been beyond me, to tell you the truth. Well,
you've got to give the old Pater his due, for trying to stretch you and
all that. That's just like him, it really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the story doesn't really go anywhere, at least not anywhere I
could fathom. Well, things happen, but it's just everyday things over
the few days after being expelled from school. The usual stuff. You
could write a whole essay, I suppose, about whether or not Caulfield
changes or learns anything by the novel's end, or simply remains an
adolescent. But I don't think that would amount to very much. So it's a
stylistic experience, at any rate. Very '&lt;em&gt;A Portrait of the Artist as a
Young Man&lt;/em&gt;' I'm sure, and you've got to give him his due.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 7/10 - Bloody Salinger, he never listens to anyone, him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>books</category><category>fiction</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/2008/9/3/the-catcher-in-the-rye/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2008 22:41:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Breakfast of Champions</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/2008/8/27/breakfast-of-champions/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2008/08/breakfast-of-champions.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Kurt Vonnegut&lt;/em&gt;, 1973.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always loved Vonnegut (who doesn't?) but I'd avoided this since
seeing the &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120618/"&gt;painful 1999 movie&lt;/a&gt;
made of it, proof if ever it were needed that some books are simply
unfilmable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel, however, is everything we love about Vonnegut. His clarity,
wit, grumpiness and simplicity. The story of ordinary people in a small
midwestern town reads like a playful Hemmingway, but forms a therapeutic
rumination on the nature of sanity, and the author's own relationship
with it, in the insane world we find ourselves in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 7/10 - and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>books</category><category>fiction</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/2008/8/27/breakfast-of-champions/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2008 20:45:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Halting State</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/2008/8/19/halting-state/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tartley.com/files/2008/08/halting-state.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2008/08/halting-state.jpg" title="halting-state"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Charles Stross&lt;/em&gt;, 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a tale of corporate shenanigans, online virtual reality computer
gaming, scams, police on the beat, software contractors, and political
intrigue, set in the midst of a near-future Scotland. It's told in first
person, by a rotating set of a half-dozen characters, which I found
distracting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scottish vernacular and the boozed-up Brit attitudes in a mildly
science-fictional setting come across as parochial rather than grungy,
and projected technologies such as self-driving cars and virtual
realities all seem too intrusive and out of place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise oscillates between nauseating and preposterous, as an
in-game robbery of virtual items gradually tips off its investigators
that someone, somewhere, has got their hands on some heavy-duty
decryption keys with which far more sinister acts are being perpetrated.
Before it's done, there is a scene where the software engineer caught in
the middle of it all has to play a swords-and-sorcery online computer
game, upon the outcome of which hangs the safety of the free world. Oh
deary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really, really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;, loved Stross' &lt;em&gt;Accelerando&lt;/em&gt;, so maybe my
expectations were just set too high. Can this really be from the same
author, and written a scant 12 months afterwards?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 3/10. Letdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>books</category><category>fiction</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/2008/8/19/halting-state/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2008 10:50:19 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>jPod</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/2008/5/7/jpod/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="jPod" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2008/05/jpodcover.jpg" title="jpodcover"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Douglas Coupland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;jPod is a flamboyant return to the corporate cube-farms of &lt;em&gt;Microserfs&lt;/em&gt;,
arguably the site of Coupland's greatest previous victories. Characters
reveal their desperation in guilty subversive rebellions against the
corporate tyranny that their apathy condemns them to be ruled by. The
artificial intimacy of long-term adjacent cubespace leads to the gleeful
exposure of each other's sexual foibles, drug habits, and all the
diverse pariphenalia with which they parade their various neuroses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an enjoyably postmodern romp, complete with art-school
typographical experiments, the recurring appearance of the author as a
minor character, and most of all, the infusion of the whimsical
philosophies of the GenX protagonists. Even so, I can't escape the
feeling that it's a retread, rather than a successor. When he wrote
&lt;em&gt;Microserfs&lt;/em&gt;, the newfound viewpoints of the digitally-savvy were fresh
and exciting, and Coupland triumphantly provided the voice they lacked.
Nowadays such views can stand on their own, indeed they are beginning to
comprise mainstream society, and observational exposition such as
Coupland's has become redundant. When a character notes with surprise
that the Kodak company still exists, and wonders how many years it has
been since they employed any young people, it might have been a wry and
insightful comment ten years ago. Now it's merely tired and lagging, by
virtue of harping on about a worldview that the target audience has all
taken as read for as long as we can remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 6/10 - A mixed bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>books</category><category>fiction</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/2008/5/7/jpod/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2008 19:37:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/2008/2/8/someone-comes-to-town-someone-leaves-town/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Someone-Comes-Town-Leaves/dp/0765312808" title="Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town"&gt;&lt;img alt="Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2008/02/someone-comes-to-town.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Cory Doctorow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just don't know about this one. I really wanted to like it. It starts
out with an interesting, down-to-earth story about a guy establishing
himself in a new neighbourhood, setting up an open wireless mesh net
across the neighbourhood, back in a day when this was still a &lt;em&gt;really
cool idea&lt;/em&gt;. This tale is then peppered with disconcerting non-literal
sounding references to his family, such as the cliffs and caves of his
Father, the mountain. By the time I'd really gotten on board with this
fantastic side of the emerging story, the scene changes were occurring
so swiftly between paragraphs that I began to wonder whether the text
hadn't got jumbled up somewhere between Cory's word processor and &lt;a href="http://tartley.com/?p=217"&gt;my
screen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I embarked upon it too casually. It was certainly engaging, but
by the last few pages I began to suspect that threads of the plot had
eluded me. For example, I had entertained the idea that the fantasy
elements of the story were actually the product of the main character's
stated intention to write a book, which is otherwise only mentioned in
passing here and there. However, the fantasy is woven extremely tightly
together with the realistic aspects of the story, such that I can't
discern any clear boundary to distinguish between the two. So I'm left
wondering if parts of the book didn't actually happen, and if so, which
parts? I should have anticipated someone like &lt;a href="http://craphound.com"&gt;Mr
Doctorow&lt;/a&gt; would have to be a terrific smarty-pants
in the narrative department, and I doubtless should have paid more
attention along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 6/10 - One to revisit, maybe, if I like his other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12th Feb:&lt;/strong&gt; Coincidentally, I just read a short story by Cory,
&lt;em&gt;I Row-boat&lt;/em&gt;, which despite the awful titular pun, I really liked.
However, I've read a bunch of discussion about &lt;em&gt;Someone Comes to
Town...&lt;/em&gt;, and I don't seem to have missed much that anyone else has been
getting out of it. So while I'm looking forward to other stuff by him,
I'm sticking by my low rating for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>books</category><category>fiction</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/2008/2/8/someone-comes-to-town-someone-leaves-town/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 08 Feb 2008 07:01:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Slaughterhouse 5</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/2007/7/22/slaughterhouse-5/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Slaughterhouse 5, cover" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/07/slaughterhouse5.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm falling way behind in my avowed intention to write up all the books
and movies I'm subjected to. Primarily for my own benefit, rather than
yours, here the first of a flurry of quick annotations that I'll never
otherwise get around to. This fell off the shelf into my hands once more
upon the news of his death in April. &lt;em&gt;So it goes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Alan Moore (author)&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;and Eddie Campbell (artist)&lt;/em&gt;,
1989.
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hell-Alan-Moore/dp/0861661419" title="From Hell"&gt;On amazon.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moore has almost single-handedly transformed the definition of the comic
industry in the last 20 years, and this fetishistically researched
comic-book dramatisation of the dark and macabre Jack the Ripper murders
is no exception to his visionary high standards. Moore plunges headlong
into the sensational conspiracy theory that Royal Physician, Dr. William
Gull, killed East End prostitutes to silence the story of an
illegitimate royal baby, under the direct orders of the implacable Queen
Victoria herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Gull regards his mission as the great work of his life, which will
not only quash the threat to the crown, but also fulfil ancient pagan
destinies, reasserting the male dominance over matriarchy that began
when the Romans reclaimed London and slew Queen Boadicea. Gull knows
this because he has knelt before his God, who told him just what needed
to be done. As a doctor, Gull knows that these visions are madness,
brought about by his stroke of the previous year. As a man, however, he
responds that "If this is madness, who'd be sane?", and, embracing the
subjective reality of his hallucinations, he goes about his work with
gusto, confiding along the way in his witless coachman and reluctant
accomplice, Nettley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Dr Gull and coachman Nettley" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/07/boadicea-died-sm.jpg" title="Dr. Gull &amp;amp; coachman Nettley"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is a tapestry, woven on many levels. The iniquities of wealth
and power are richly depicted as the poverty-stricken residents of the
East End are contrasted with the powers-that-be, who move swiftly and
decisively to ensure that Gull is never caught nor found out, for fear
of scandal, even while he goes on killing with impunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appalling violence of the murders and dismemberment of the victims
is shown in unflinching detail, one pivotal 34-page chapter "The Best of
all Tailors", consisting solely of the actions of Gull, a renowned
surgeon, with his victim in a tiny, squalid room, which made me
profoundly grateful that the sketches are only in black-and-white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such graphic nastiness is not for no reason. Gull is convinced that the
act of violence is a pivotal part of the ancient and grisly prophesies
he is enacting. Under the psychological strain of each successive
murder, Gull experiences increasingly vivid hallucinations, symptoms of
his condition. But then, something altogether strange starts to happen.
As his visions become more vivid, Gull begins to experience glimpses of
the future. Visions of our time. At times and places where people have
historically claimed to have seen the ghost of Jack the Ripper, Moore
cunningly reverses the perspective, allowing Gull to see them also. By
the end, Gull's visions have him stalking the sterile hallways of the
modern world in blood-soaked shirtsleeves, roaring at oblivious office
workers, exhorting them to look up and remember the history from which
our century was birthed in blood. The ancient magic that Gull raved
