&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a few pages to shift gears to match the provocatively casual style,
but once I did, it quickly became an engrossing and endearing read.
The book collects a series of tiny but grand adventures, each riffing on one
of the titular Ed's fabulous new inventions or discoveries. Together these
form an arc which burns through combinations of high-concept SF ideas at an
unseemly rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reminded me of what I've fondly said about 200AD (the galaxy's greatest
comic), that somehow the superficiality of the medium allows
writers to experiment more wildly with form and content, throwing up a torrent
of creativity which, while sometimes uneven, generates moments of sheer
brilliance. I thought being a comic was an essential part of that formula. But
&lt;em&gt;Ed&lt;/em&gt; proves me wrong by achieving the same velocity of verve and vigor,
rendered in prose. A delight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Epilogue reminds me gleefully of
&lt;a href="https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/a/151964/13496"&gt;this stackoverflow worldbuilding answer&lt;/a&gt;
I gave a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those like me with an epub fetish, you can buy &lt;em&gt;Ed&lt;/em&gt; in many formats,

&lt;img alt="Ra cover" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2021/ra-by-qntm-cover.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought all four of &lt;a href="https://qntm.org/fiction"&gt;qntm's books&lt;/a&gt;
when I discovered the fantastic
&lt;a href="https://www.tartley.com/posts/there-is-no-antimemetics-division/"&gt;There is no Antimemetics Division&lt;/a&gt;.
I didn't really expect to like all of them, sight unseen, but was delighted to
support an emerging author who had contributed to the genius of SCP. But then
the books that arrived turned out to be bloody brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one tells a tale in which magic was discovered to be real in the 1970s,
becoming a new, arcane branch of physics. From there, it piles on the twists
and raises the stakes at an enthralling and dizzying rate, demanding the
reader to keep up through many exciting layered reveals and escalating changes
of perspective. Absolutely smashing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;em&gt;Antimemetics&lt;/em&gt;, it scores points with me for including some female heroes,
who surmount challenges through some striking strengths of character &amp;amp;
expertise, rather than simply being the best at applied violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="There is No Antimemetics Division cover" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2021/there-is-no-antimemetics-division-cover.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first became aware of this book when I noticed that the good folks over
at &lt;a href="http://www.scpwiki.com/"&gt;The SCP Foundation&lt;/a&gt; have kept themselves busy in
the years since I last looked over their peerless and endlessly enthralling
wiki of dry and tantalizing protocols with which to "Secure, Contain, and
Protect" a catalog of creepy anomalous artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the arcs to break the churning surface of that crowdsourced
fictional millieu is that of the
&lt;a href="http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/antimemetics-division-hub"&gt;Antimemetics Division&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"An antimeme is an idea which, by its intrinsic nature, discourages people
from spreading it. Think of ideas that you wouldn't share - passwords,
taboos, shameful secrets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anomalous antimemes are another matter entirely. How do you contain
something you can't record, or remember? How do you fight an enemy when you
can never even know you're at war?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to the Antimemetics Division.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, this is not your first day."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intruiged, I started clicking around, and as is the way of SCP, discovered
many hours had passed. Shortly afterwards, I realized the arc has been
collected into this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasional SCP entries, in the format we know and love, intertwine a short but
intense tale of memetic hazards, populated by a few of the Division's
finest - those rare individuals who can go from the standing start of a hint
that their memories can't be trusted, to a well-executed plan based upon
a stack of assumptions about what might be needed, and what might already have
been done that they can count upon, even though they no longer remember any of
it, without ever retaining any knowledge of their situation, or what they're up
against. I don't think I've ever been so impressed by the sheer depth of a
character's resourcefulness and initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey does contain world-ending hellscapes, with some gore, which might
not be everyone's cup of tea. But it's short and somehow manages to stay light
in tone, so isn't emotionally arduous on that front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably my favorite fiction of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Swamp Thing cover" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2019/06/swamp-thing-vol-1.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Alan Moore, Jogn Totleben, &amp;amp; Steve Bissette&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moore's deconstruction of existing characters continues. Originally Swamp Thing
was Alec Holland, miraculously transformed by an infusion of artificially
stimulated plant matter. When Alan Moore takes over the writing, Swamp Thing's
ostracization and existential dread is compounded by the discovery that this
origins story has been a delusion all along. Alec Holland was killed outright
in the accident, and an accumulation of plant matter grew around his decaying
form, integrating the physical remains of his memories into a creature that
yearned to recapture its human form, but was never human in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Miracleman cover" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2019/06/miracleman.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Alan Moore, Alan Davies, &amp;amp; John Totleben.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a little time digging out earlier works of Alan Moore. These
inter-library loans didn't disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally published as &lt;em&gt;Marvelman&lt;/em&gt; by Mick Anglo, from
1954-59. Legal battles rebranded the character as &lt;em&gt;Miracleman&lt;/em&gt; in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening pages reprint one of those campy early stories, involving
primary-colored moralizing while flying around to punch time-travelling Nazi
super-scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then continue with Alan Moore's postmodern 1980s reboot. This recasts the
simplistic tales of the original period as a placating dream, fed to a captured
Miracleman by his nemesis. His hokey origins story is similarly re-ploughed. The
ensuing tales are dark and introspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thread follows the emotional stresses placed on Miracleman when incarnated
as his human alter-ego, the frail and fallible half of a godlike being. He's
unable to conceive a child with his wife, although &lt;em&gt;Miracleman&lt;/em&gt; can, and
succumbs to self-loathing and jealousy, culminating in a touching scene in
which he climbs a mountain, leaves a forlorn monument, and changes into
Miracleman one last time, never to change back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is more uneven than Moore's later works. Yes, it's unashamedly an
underwear-on-the-outside superhero story. But nonetheless I loved it, and
scenes like the above stayed with me for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also this month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Atrocity Archive&lt;/strong&gt; by Charles Stross. The conceit of Lovecraftian horror
rationalized to a mathematical or computable topic is appealing to me, and
kept the pages turning, but I didn't ultimately find it life-changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nightwings&lt;/strong&gt; by Robert Silverberg. A fantastical far-future tale of humanity
split into occupational castes, guarding the world against prophesied
invasion. Not my thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Greg Bear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A smashing hard SF tale, about the existential mystery of life aboard a
generation starship that has lost its way. Following in the footsteps of
classic variations, such as &lt;em&gt;Non-Stop&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Methusalah's Children&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tau
Zero&lt;/em&gt;, it centers around the character's revelations as they uncover their
situation and origins, being decanted to order by warring factions amongst
high technology ruins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Richard Morgan&lt;/em&gt; (2001)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A romp through a hyperviolent cyberpunk future through the eyes of a
character reluctantly press-ganged into the role of detective in a story
woven around personality uploads, swaps, and backups. I did enjoy it,
but was put off by the main character winning their victories
by consecutive applications of remorseless violence. There's no cleverness
or examinations of morality here, just that the character cast as the "goodie"
triumphs by being better at beating people up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/10 if you're looking to kick back on the couch with tea, cake, and
some exciting SF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0/10 if you're not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by David Foster Wallace (1999)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A collection of creative essays, varying from playful to unflinchingly
uncomfortable, shot through with Wallace's typical humour and
introspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've tended to love and hate his &lt;a href="https://www.tartley.com/infinite-jest"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.tartley.com/everything-and-more"&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; in equal measure, but with such
ferocity that I unreservedly place him amongst my very favourite
authors. There wasn't even much for me to hate in this one, relatively
lacking as it is in labyrinthine footnotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of the essays left me cold (&lt;em&gt;Tri-Stan: I Sold Sissee Nar to
Ecko&lt;/em&gt; springs to mind - presumably I'm missing the point entirely),
but most of them I found thoroughly engaging and
thought provoking. I'm tempted to read up on those that seemed most
challenging to me (&lt;em&gt;Church Not Made With Hands&lt;/em&gt;, say), and give them
another try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a while. Rating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0/10 if you don't want to delve deeply into sometimes uncomfortable
subjects, such as depression, unconventional sex acts, and rape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/10 if you like to be stretched, or at least stirred around, in
interesting directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Makers cover" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2009/makers-cover.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Cory Doctorow&lt;/em&gt; (not yet published.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://craphound.com/"&gt;Cory&lt;/a&gt; very kindly brought an early manuscript of
this as a gift to &lt;a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www.gilesthomas.com/"&gt;Giles&lt;/a&gt; and I when we met him a while ago,
and I've been wracked with guilt ever since because I apparently lost it
soon after. Thankfully, it recently turned up (on
&lt;a href="http://babbageclunk.com/"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt;'s desk - my fault!) last week, so
I happily finished it pronto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's his best fiction yet! He must be honing his abilities with
practice. \o/ Michael do you want it next?.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian doesn't like my subjectivity-proof rating system, so this one
is specially for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/10 if you want a lightly styled but deeply speculative and engrossing
story that winds a like a sightseeing tour around the social and
personal ramifications of the ways in which modern technology is
changing the way people interact, organise and get things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0/10: If you aren't interested in the ways society is changing under our
feet.&lt;/p&gt;
