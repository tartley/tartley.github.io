preciously audiophile about it. Aaaaand also I'm wording this with the
assumption you're a Linux, command-line and Python nerd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it's a video which is explicitly Creative Commons. Other times, it's
a friend's otherwise unpublished non-commercial thing. Or maybe it's a massive
commercial product from a famously litigious corporate behemoth, but you've
already bought the soundtrack and you just really &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wish you had a
version which had the exact same sound effects or dialog or arrangement that
you or your child has grown to love from obsessive movie re-watches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've got ya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;One-off setup:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;a href="https://ffmpeg.org/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a venerable open-source command-line
video/audio conversion tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;sudo&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;apt&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ffmpeg
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, install &lt;a href="https://pypa.github.io/pipx/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;pipx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a tool to install
commmand-line tools that are distributed as Python packages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;python3&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-m&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pip&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--user&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pipx
python3&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-m&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pipx&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ensurepath
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, use pipx to install the &lt;a href="https://youtube-dl.org/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an
oft-sued but never vanquished tool to download YouTube videos. (We're using
the Python package because the apt package is too old to work):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;pipx&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;youtube-dl
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Goal fulfillment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, download your precious audio:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;youtube-dl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-x&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--audio-format&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;best&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;URL
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;URL&lt;/code&gt; is the encoded version of the video URL (i.e. like "youtu.be/XXX"),
  obtained by hitting the 'share' button on the YouTube page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-x&lt;/code&gt; requests just the audio part, with no video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While &lt;code&gt;--audio-format=best&lt;/code&gt; is ostensibly the default setting, meaning
  YouTube decides which format to send, using &lt;code&gt;-x&lt;/code&gt; seems to fail if we don't
  specify this explicitly. Alternatively, you can explicitly request "aac",
  "flac", "mp3", "m4a", "opus", "vorbis", or "wav". As I understand it, YouTube
  will only send the requested format if the uploader provided it. If they
  didn't then we get whatever YouTube provides and then convert it locally
  using ffmpeg. So you sometimes won't be getting the benefit of those lossless
  formats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But mp3 works well enough for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSJWvzLuGz8"&gt;my&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENVIoR2f-Qgh"&gt;needs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, for playlists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;youtube-dl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-x&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--audio-format&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;best&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--yes-playlist&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-i&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;URL
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--yes-playlist&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;--no-playlist&lt;/code&gt; chooses which to download if the URL you
  provide is both a playlist and a video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-i&lt;/code&gt; ignores errors, so one bad track in the playlist doesn't stop the whole
  thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My previous inferior way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method is worse because it downloads the whole video file before
extracting audio locally, and the download gets throttled by YouTube in
some way, which of late is very slow indeed, i.e. substantially slower
than watching the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the video from YouTube:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;youtube-dl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;URL
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This results in a webm file. I have no idea what that is, and am relieved
to discover that converting it into an mp3 requires just:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;ffmpeg&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-i&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;MyVideoFile&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-vn&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;MyAudioFile.mp3
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code&gt;-vn&lt;/code&gt; disables video in the output.&lt;/p&gt;

esteemed Marios. It's been heaps of fun, and it's long past time I
shared my progress to date, in the form of some ghastly midi files.
Download at your peril, they are truly awful - only of interest as a
record of my progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Beautiful Brown Eyes&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a tune labelled as 'Beautiful Brown Eyes'. This is from a couple
of weeks ago, the first time I managed to record a midi file. The
timing's very sloppy - I haven't been learning any pieces by heart, so
I'm struggling to read the music fast enough to play the tune. I'm
trying to play as many different pieces as I can by reading the sheet
music, rather than learning a few by heart, since that will hopefully
exercise my ability to read music, albeit at the cost of sounding much
less polished for the time being. That's my excuse and I'm sticking to
it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/07/07-06-28-beautiful-brown-eyes.mid" title="Beautiful Brown Eyes, 2007-06-28"&gt;&lt;img alt="MIDI icon" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/07/midifile.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
28 Jun&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Alpine Melody&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, an even simpler tune, which means I have less difficulty
reading the music and so the timing's a bit better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/07/07-07-16-alpine-melody.mid" title="Alpine Melody, 2007-07-16"&gt;&lt;img alt="MIDI icon" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/07/midifile.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
16 Jul&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Tetris&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the music from the computer game Tetris. This is a fairly new
tune to me, and it's obvious that it's a real struggle. I'm not used to
reading such large melodic intervals, and the notes extends over a
broader pitch range than anything I've done before, so I can scarcely
place my fingers on the right keys, never mind in time. Hopefully this
will get better with practice.&lt;/p&gt;

Or at least, it is
for me. This is my first attempt to pen some notes by plonking around on
the keyboard until it sounds right. Doubtless errors of all kinds
abound, which I'd be much obliged if anyone pointed out to me, tar very
much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/06/score-largo.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>music</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/music-101c2be/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jun 2007 03:23:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Music 101½</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/music-101c2bd/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;It's been said before by others, but I hadn't realised how insidious it
is: When musicians talk about 'theory', they actually mean 'notation'.
With reference to my &lt;a href="http://tartley.com/?p=100"&gt;previous whinging&lt;/a&gt;
about music notation, I notice that the &lt;a href="http://www.mnma.org/"&gt;Music Notation Modernization
Association&lt;/a&gt; are suggesting a number of revisions
to make notation more useful and consistent. One of the more prominent
suggestions is a change to the use of staves to make them compatible
with the octave-offset principle I mentioned earlier, thus making the
appearance of notes consistent across all staves, and making the use of
clefs of any kind redundant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above idea especially comes into its own when combined with their
other proposals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chromatic staves&lt;/em&gt; to indicate intervals in a proportional manner
(rather than the current bonkers '♯' and '♭' notation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="chromatic-intervals.gif" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/06/chromatic-intervals.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twinline&lt;/em&gt; staves, which only require two horizontal lines, rather
than the conventional five, provides a significant increase in
readability, in keeping with Tufte's principle of
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142/"&gt;maximising data-ink ratio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="twinline.gif" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/06/twinline.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note color&lt;/em&gt; or shape used to discriminate pitch, rather than the
current quirky use of partially indicating note length. This is
perhaps my favourite, as it massively increases the ease of rapidly
identifying notes on sight. Since note colour is currently used to
distinguish between a minim and a crotchet, then some other way of
making them distinct would have to be found. A unique flag on the
note stem would seem to suffice, and would be more in keeping with
the other note duration symbology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="note-color.gif" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/06/note-color.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After what looks like years of painstaking brainstorming, research,
focus testing and refinement, the only thing left for the MNMA to do is
to decide on one single notation that unambiguously combines all the
above ideas, and promote its use with the aim of gradually supplanting
conventional notation. Unfortunately, this seems to be something they
have singularly failed to do. By failing to adopt and recommend a single
notation, they seem to be ensuring that none of their ideas will ever
gain any traction.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>music</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/music-101c2bd/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jun 2007 15:37:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Music 101</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/music-101/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Treble clef" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/05/treble-clef.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been riding high on the sheer joy that is Guitar Hero II (PS2) recently.
Now that &lt;em&gt;Psychobilly Freakout&lt;/em&gt; is the only remaining song for which a
five-star review performance is still eluding me, before unleashing the
masochistically feverish &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; difficulty setting at least, it's time
for me to get my ass into gear and learn to play a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; musical
instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dithering
between piano / keyboard and acoustic / electric guitar, I've decided to
take a few week's lessons in each, to see which initially suits me best.
Accordingly (Speaking of which, I also find the accordion strangely
compelling), I had my first ever piano lesson this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mariostakoushis.com/html/about.php" title="Mr Marios Takoushis"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mr Marios Takoushis" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/05/marious.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My tutor,
&lt;a href="http://www.mariostakoushis.com/html/about.php"&gt;Marios&lt;/a&gt;, an amiable
Greek professional musician with appropriately mad hair, seems like a
brilliant choice thus far: I'm sure we'll get along famously, with only
the minimum amount of absolutely necessary knuckle-rapping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 14:35:&lt;/strong&gt; Just remembered: One of the first puzzling things I
discovered is that notes on the bass clef stave are offset from the
notes on the treble clef stave by a non-integer number of octaves.
Hence, a note which would represent 'C' on a treble clef stave is
actually an 'E' when drawn on a bass clef stave. Presumably there's a
reason for this, but I've yet to hear an explanation that sounds like
anything other than a wart on the notation. Can any of my multitudinous
readers enlighten me?&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>journal</category><category>music</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/music-101/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 14 May 2007 15:37:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Onegin vs New Super Mario Bros</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/onegin-vs-new-super-mario-bros/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;The match:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week was full of great artistic experiences, but none so sublime as
these two masterpieces, which I was lucky enough to witness and
complete, respectively, in the last few days. For reasons that I'm sure
need no explanation, I've opted to review them side-by-side in a single
post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/03/nes_super_mario_bros.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Pushkin's original novel, seen here in the English translation.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of Onegin derives from a Russian novel-in-verse, &lt;em&gt;Eugene
Onegin&lt;/em&gt; written by Aleksandr Pushkin over the period from 1823 to 1837.
It was considered a classic of Russian literature, well-loved enough to
be quoted from memory by most Russians. Forty years later, Tchaikovsky
and Konstantin Shilovsky created the music and libretto respectively for
an operatic version of the same tale. This opera was then choreographed
as a ballet by Cranko in 1965, and it is Stolze's 2007 arrangement of
this that is now playing at the Royal Opera House in London's Covent
Garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/03/eugeneonegin-book.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros. on the NES&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Super Mario Bros, similarly, represents the culmination of a
venerated franchise. The character of Mario first appeared as a nameless
16x16 pixel carpenter in the vintage arcade hit &lt;em&gt;Donkey Kong&lt;/em&gt; (1981),
and was then retooled as a plumber and christened for &lt;em&gt;Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;
(1983). The core gameplay mechanics of the Mushroom Kingdom were not
formulated until &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; (1985), but have formed backbone to
the series ever since. Mario has adapted nimbly to several new
generations of home consoles and handhelds, but the most significant
technical evolution came with &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; (1996), which made a
superlative triumph out of the difficult transition to 3D, one that
continues to stymie many of his
&lt;a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/12/13/what-funk-is-sega-in/"&gt;contemporaries&lt;/a&gt;
even to this day. Meanwhile, Mario continues to form the iconic mainstay
character in what is generally recognised as the most successful, and
certainly the most influential, videogame series of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/03/jump.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Flawlessly timed triple jumps result in extra height.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like so many other DS outings, New Super Mario Bros. is very much a
return to form for the champion platformer. It makes solid, competent
use of the DS's dual screens and touch-sensitive technology, and brings
together the highlights of its distinguished lineage: peerless standards
of level design; an endearing levity; crisp, unambiguous graphics; a
roster of nostalgically well-known characters with their various
abilities and affiliations, and of course the pixel-perfect precision of
control that is the very embodiment of Mario. On top of the traditional
2D Mario mechanics, Nintendo have applied their usual expertise,
seamlessly incorporating moves from &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; et al, enriching
and polishing the control scheme, while never complicating it.
Wall-jumps, a ground-pound, and a triple-jump, complete with a couple of
cheerily superficial somersaults. Never has a controller been so
unintimidatingly overloaded with kinetic potential - latent at at first,
but blossoming by the third act, when Tatiana, now grown into a charming
and sophisticated woman, introduces her husband, Prince Gremin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narrative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both works have in common the attempt to convey a narrative without the
aid of verbiage, with significant difficulties encountered in each case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/03/1703471_onegin_150a.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Dumb, as in mime.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballet suffers from an inexpressiveness in this regard, insomuch as the
tools at the dancer's disposal are not capable of depicting much in the
way of nuanced or fine-grained detail outside of particular,
well-trodden areas. Characters may meet, part, or die, and express all
manner of elation or sorrow as they go about it, but there are only a
limited number of stories that can be told from such components. It is
difficult to imagine, say, a political thriller, or even something as
familiar and staid as a murder mystery being told without resorting to
&lt;em&gt;Spandau&lt;/em&gt; ballet. Because of this, the medium as a whole seems to have
become something of a creative cul-de-sac, preoccupied with retelling
the same formulaic stories over and over again - and even these are
considered to be in need of supplementing with a written synopsis in the
program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Disrupting the narrative direction.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, videogames revolve around the participation of the player,
who thus has the means to disrupt any narrative direction or pacing
anticipated by the game designer. Whatever story can be told, must
perforce be introduced either by the forced insertion of jarringly
ungamelike exposition, during which the player is frustratingly robbed
of any real input, or else must be told using the limited demonstrative
repertoire of in-game action. New Super Mario Bros. sidesteps these
difficulties by eschewing all but the most perfunctory storyline, aside
from a grown-up nod to the sordid realities behind Bowser's recurrent
princess kidnapping, hinted at by Bowser Jr. labouring under the
impression than Princess Peach may be his mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall Impressions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their weaknesses, each of these works represents a good, solid
entry in representing the best that the mainstream of their respective
fields have to offer. Two marvellous, vigorous and thoroughly enjoyable
outings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Onegin&lt;/strong&gt;
Rating 8/10.

&lt;p&gt;I promised myself I'd endure no more musicals, but somehow an exception
seems appropriate for this beautiful idiocy. Sometimes muppets can say
what men cannot.&lt;/p&gt;

well-known for the talented and distinctive timbre of their brass
section, so it was with some interest that I found myself ushered along
to this opportunity to hear them strut their stuff from centre stage,
unencumbered by the rest of the orchestra. It was my first visit to the
2,000 seat Barbican Hall, which as venues go could not be in sharper
contrast to the Royal Albert Hall which hosted Susan and my last
orchestral outing. Along with most people, I wince at the heavy-handed
post-war modernist lines of its exterior, but nevertheless can't help
but admire the boldness and consistency with which such ambitious
architectural and social vision was applied to the entirely of the
enourmous Barbican Estate within which it nestles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And being modern isn't all bad, because the manifold engineered
improvements to the concert hall's acoustics of the last couple of
decades seem very much to have produced the desired effect - I would
describe the clarity and range of sound to which my inexperienced ear
was subjected as nothing short of startling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ten-strong array of trumpets, trombones and tuba played a selection
to showcase their respective talents, with a zest and levity that I am
informed is their usual stock in trade, including Paul Archibald's brass
arrangement of Prokofiev's Ten Pieces for Piano, Op 12; Saint-Saëns'
Carnival of the Animals; Debussy's Keyboard Pieces; James Maynard's
Zoology and Gershwin's Porgy and Bess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not being overly familiar with orchestral music, the thing that struck
me was how much the exercise seemed to celebrate the precision and
craftsmanship that the musicians could bring to bear on the reproduction
of the music, rather than the sheer visceral joy of the music itself
which so predominates at a pop gig or night club. I'm told in no
uncertain terms by those with more experience of brass ensembles that
the experience of rhapsody is equally present, but I'm having trouble
reconciling that with my impressions of an audience which was captivated
and delighted, but also entirely motionless for the entire performance.
Somehow in my mind, the idea of overwhelming musical ecstasy is
inseparably associated with a irresistible, participatory physical
motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly I have much to learn. Baby steps. :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>media</category><category>music</category><category>theater</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/london-symphony-orchestras-brass-ensemble/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Mar 2007 04:59:37 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
