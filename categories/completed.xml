&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Released on PlayStation 3 by thatgamecompany in 2012. Played on Windows 10 in
2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slow-paced opening scenes, alternately trudging up and then surfing down
sunbaked desert dunes, failed to sustain Zander's interest, so I ended up
playing through its short runtime by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways it's an indictment of videogame culture that ten years later it
still feels so fresh and radical to pair players up with another internet
rando, while giving them no means to communicate or interact other than helping
each other out, either leading by example, or exchanging wordless shouts. It
seems like a pretty limited repertoire at first. I'm half tempted to just wander
off ahead, alone, into the endless desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, you realize that standing close enough together recharges each other's
magical flying scarves. Suddenly, it's enough. You cling to each other for dear
life through the howling storms, double back to rescue each other from prowling
beasts, and then fly exuberantly above the sunlit clouds, forever curving back
to seek each other's life-giving sustenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know who the two internet randos were, with whom I shared the first and
second halves of my journey. But in those minutes together, we lived a
lifetime's worth.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>completed</category><category>media</category><category>videogame</category><category>windows</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/journey/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 11:22:20 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Manifold Garden</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/manifold-garden/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float: left"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Manifold Garden screenshot" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2021/manifold-garden.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows, 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was always going to turn my head, marrying a marvellous geometric engine
to an austere, flat-shaded renderer. Bewildering portals, seamlessly disguised
as humble doorways, are the simplest of its tricks. More pervasive, levels are
wraparound along all three spatial dimensions, as can be seen by the
disorienting arrays of geometry - the current level, infinitely repeated,
offset or re-oriented - marching to the vanishing points, dwindling to infinity
in all directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is no mere trippy backdrop. Gravity can be trivially flipped to lie along
any cardinal axis, and one will routinely step off, into a yawning, infinite
abyss, to fall through the entire level, and beyond, through and amongst the
infinite constellations of geometry, airsteering all the way, to land,
unharmed, anywhere that's exposed to the direction you're falling from. It
becomes a form of teleportation, used to get from A to B almost as frequently
as simply walking around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This non-Euclidean wrapping is baked deeply into the visuals, the engine, and
the gameplay. But for all that technical mastery, the puzzles themselves aren't
as deep and creative and varied as those in the ostensibly similar, but
less technically accomplished, &lt;em&gt;Antichamber&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, there's something entirely appropriate in this. The puzzles
end up being as much rituals as a head-scratchers, holy spatial rites one
performs to unleash the deeply evocative visuals towards the end of each level
- a faceted and angular psychedelic, coupled with unnerving reformulations of
reality straight out of Farbrausch's
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqu_IpkOYBg"&gt;Debris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. By the final level,
this crescendos in scenes reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, profound in
both the intimacy of my commune with godhood, and in my continued inability to
understand what I had achieved. Created a universe, probably? Yeah, probably.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>completed</category><category>media</category><category>videogame</category><category>windows</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/manifold-garden/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 03:16:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Legend of Zelda : The Phantom Hourglass</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/legend-of-zelda-the-phantom-hourglass/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float: left"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Phantom Hourglass" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2008/05/phantom-hourglass.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo, 2008&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nintendo spin off a &lt;em&gt;fourteenth&lt;/em&gt; iteration of the familiar and
oh-so-beloved franchise. I'd only previously played the
preposterously-sub-titled &lt;em&gt;Ocarina of Time&lt;/em&gt; on the N64, of which I
retain fond, sepia-coloured memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;em&gt;Phantom Hourglass&lt;/em&gt; to be engaging, and played it to a
thoroughly jolly completion over the course of a couple of months. The
gameplay and plot are a tad more casual and lightweight than &lt;em&gt;Ocarina&lt;/em&gt;,
as befitting play snatched while on-the-go on the handheld platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the DS stylus to control Link is delightfully transparent and
intuitive. Just as for a mouse, however, expert users will eventually
eschew it for many actions, preferring the speed, precision and
tactility of distinct physical buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the down side, some of the puzzles are downright contrived. After
introducing a handy little map, on which you can scrawl notes and
reminders for yourself, the game then promptly takes it away again for
&lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the levels on which it would be of most use, proclaiming 'you
can't use the map here, some sort of magic prevents it.' Right. Up
yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equally intrusive, the dialog is entirely Nintendo-esque cutesy Japanese
schmultz, and it would have improved the game no end for it to have been
entirely absent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such niggles are few and far between, though. Time for another go of the
newfangled rating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: Place yourself somewhere between...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/10 if you're into a deftly executed handheld riff on the Zelda
series, beautifully integrated with the affordances and sensibilities of
the hosting hardware in that way that only Nintendo can do. Lots to love
here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0/10 if you're done with revisiting timeworn ideas, even ones as
compelling and charming as this, and yearn for a resurgence in
experimental originality to kick the gaming industry out of one or two
ruts (such as having a blind spot for crappy dialog.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="clear: both"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>completed</category><category>media</category><category>videogame</category><category>windows</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/legend-of-zelda-the-phantom-hourglass/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2009 20:36:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Shadow of the Colossus</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/shadow-of-the-colossus/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float: left"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2009/01/sotc4-300x225.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team ICO, PS2, 2005.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is common for a title released in the autumn years of a console's
lifetime, the programmers at Team ICO have mastered the PS2 hardware,
and wring the utmost from it for this virtuoso performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gameplay consists of nothing more than a series of sixteen boss
fights between your character and a succession of gigantic mythical
creatures, each rising from the landscape upon your approach. Half
stone, half furry flesh, these colossi shake the earth as they walk, and
facing up to them, armed with nothing but a sword and a bow, elicits a
genuine rush of fear, firstly as their size and magnificence become
apparent, then as they stand up, and then, finally, terrifyingly, as
they &lt;em&gt;see you&lt;/em&gt;. Like moments from a piercing dream, playing this game is
an experience that will not be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's in this emotive ability that the game's strength lies, and the
initial adrenaline is only the most coarse example of it. Those disposed
to gallop directly in the hinted direction of the the next objective
would be missing out on large parts of what &lt;em&gt;Colossus&lt;/em&gt; has to offer, and
would be well advised to ease back, enjoy the view, and take some
pleasure from the journey. For fully half your time will be spent
traversing this epic landscape in search of your next quarry, and the
landscape is fantastic, in every sense. Across open plains, rent by
canyons and gorges spanned by ancient, elegant arches, past thundering
waterfalls, though shafts of sunlight across boulder-strewn forest
floors. Cutting through mighty, vine-covered ruins, now occupied only by
lizards and hawks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tranquil exploration is punctuated by the excitement of the
battles, forming a delightful sense of anticipation. The battles
themselves are gripping and rewarding, and provides a enough of a
challenge to stimulate a corresponding level of victorious elation upon
bringing down each of the colossi. Interestingly, as the game
progresses, the tone of the animations and solemn music begin to subtly
expose these victories for what they are: the slaughter of a magical,
unique and irreplaceable creature, leaving the world a more forlorn and
empty place. This effectively leverages the player's third-person
complicity in the killings, eventually evoking feelings of guilt for
your premeditated attacks on your ultimately vulnerable victims.
Reflective of your character's determination, heedlessly pursuing an
outcome that is hinted at in his own deteriorating appearance, you have
no choice but to carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overlaid on this evolving cyclic structure, a delicate narrative is
unobtrusively woven, complete with possibly the most affecting death of
a character in any videogame to date. The story culminates by
exquisitely dovetailing with the opening of the game &lt;em&gt;Ico&lt;/em&gt; (PS2, Team
Ico, 2001), making this &lt;em&gt;Ico'&lt;/em&gt;s prequel (and finally explaining that
game's protagonist's stigmatic horns.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've said it before and I'll say it again. Videogames are a nascent,
immature medium. None amongst us can so much as dream of what they will
one day be capable of. Look upon works such as this as history in the
making, the first time a human has wrought a creative endeavour such as
this, pushing forward the expectations and outlook of the whole
industry, and spellbinding a generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, we're done here. You may leave. Time for me to begin my
experiments with a new subjectivity-proof rating system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: Position yourself appropriately somewhere between:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/10 if you wish to enjoy the state of the art in what videogames as a
medium are capable of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0/10 if you are incapable of appreciating beauty or have no soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/06/facade-game.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Procedural Arts (PC, 2006)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;img alt="spoilers" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/spoilers.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.interactivestory.net/"&gt;http://www.interactivestory.net/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FaÃ§ade&lt;/em&gt; is an art and research project which aims to extend the remit
of gaming, making a bold raid deep into rarely-explored territory. It
opens with a voicemail, inviting you to visit old friends, and then
presents the player with a first-person view from outside your caller's
apartment door. Stepping up briskly, I was just getting to grips with
the mouse cursor's context-sensitive prompt to knock on the door, when I
began to discern the muffled but unmistakable sounds of an argument
going on inside. The familiar sinking feeling invoked as you screw up
your courage, overcome your hesitation, and knock regardless, is
possibly a gaming first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awkward social situations are nothing new in other media, but the
&lt;em&gt;complicity&lt;/em&gt; engendered by interactivity and first-person immersion
enhances the effect. It's a rich vein, and the ensuing interactive drama
mines it deeply - starting with the knock, upon which a voice fiercely
whispers "He's here &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt;? I thought you said 8 o'clock?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your hosts Trip and Grace do their best to welcome you gracefully, but
there's clearly tension in the air. You can speak to them at any point
just by typing on the keyboard, and navigate the apartment, or mess with
its fixtures, using the mouse. The story that unfolds is highly
dependant on your behaviour, as Trip and Grace respond to you and to
each other, using a social AI system developed specifically for this
project. Consequentially, the storyline and its outcome varies massively
from one replay to the next - although similar themes are often brought
out somewhere along the way: the Italian holiday that no-one wants to
talk about; the 'experimental' decor - a symptom of Grace's frustration
with her uncreative graphic design job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no goals, no score. No explicit measures of success. Judging
by my few replays, the evening can end in one of a small number of ways,
some of them are sad or embarrassing, others, perhaps the more elusive
ones, are happy or hopeful. If the player chooses to adopt the
attainment of a particular story-ending as a self-assigned goal, then
that's up to them - and surely that's the very essence of what
interactivity is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FaÃ§ade&lt;/em&gt; isn't without its flaws. The graphics are perfunctory - which
is arguably a positive, since it's Southpark visual style steers well
clear of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley"&gt;the Valley&lt;/a&gt;, but
will doubtless repel the superficiality of the mainstream. Similarly,
the AI has a limited repertoire - it only knows how to converse around
particular topics, using the words and phrases that have been recorded
by voice actors. Again though, this has an upside, as the confines of
the two-room apartment, its three occupants, and the prominence of their
relationship problems all serve to reinforce the intensity of the
situation. More pertinently though, even within these constraints the AI
isn't perfect - this is a research project after all. The inevitable
failure to recognise your typed input is often handled relatively
gracefully, by a confused look from Trip or Grace, or an abrupt subject
change, passed off as a deliberate avoidance of the topic you were
broaching - a tactic that sometimes actually becomes more effective and
engaging the more insistent your attempts become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's often-cited in the game development world that the industry is
still not mature enough to know how to write a game that can make the
player cry. The current state-of-the art is comparable to the crude
motion-pictures of the late 19th century. Who would have believed,
watching the grainy, silent flickering of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Ott%27s_Sneeze"&gt;Fred Ott's
Sneeze&lt;/a&gt;, the narrative
and emotional finesse to which that medium would one day soar? For all
its faults, it's in increments such as &lt;em&gt;FaÃ§ade&lt;/em&gt; that gaming moves in the
same direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 9/10.

By Adam Foster, 2006.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;img alt="spoilers" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/spoilers.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Title screen" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/04/metastasis_1_background0000.jpg"&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the digital ink is barely dry on my assertions that videogames have
problems telling a story, when what should fall into my lap but one of
those rare and immaculate counter-examples to shut me right up.
&lt;a href="http://www.hylobatidae.org/minerva/"&gt;Minerva: Metastatis&lt;/a&gt; is a
bedroom-coded Half-Life 2 (HL2) mod that develops a storyline set within
the HL2 universe, a new thread in the tale of the alien Combine's
invasion of Earth. It has been three years in the making, and it's
&lt;em&gt;bloody brilliant&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/04/metastasis_10004.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The baseline HL2 gameplay is not changed one iota. Metastasis eschews
the normal stock-in-trade of the mod scene, introducing no new enemies,
no new weapons, no new assets such as bitmaps or sound effects. Instead,
it envelops the player in an enthralling atmospheric experience, with a
compelling backstory and superb player motivation, using a sublime
combination of architecture, geometric composition, intensely creative
injected textual fragments and well-considered use of music. This is
backed up by the superbly crafted accompanying
&lt;a href="http://www.hylobatidae.org/minerva/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, that does its best to
misinform and manipulate, drawing upon the best of various &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game"&gt;alternate
reality game&lt;/a&gt;
influences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Shoreline" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/04/metastasis_10012.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game opens with your character dumped unceremoniously out of a
helicopter by forces unknown, onto a beach under hostile fire. Running
for cover is the only option. Once out of immediate danger, your plight
is revealed in stages by a series of messages squirted onto your
protective suit's HUD by some agency identifying themselves as
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva"&gt;Minerva&lt;/a&gt;, as in the Roman Goddess
of crafts and wisdom, a.k.a, as
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Snow-Crash-Bantam-Spectra-Book/dp/0553380958"&gt;Stephenson&lt;/a&gt;
would have it, the Goddess of technology. Minerva's communications are
enigmatic and aloof. You are being used as her sentient reconnaissance
tool, your experiences relayed back to her remote location, that she
might investigate a small island, and its role in the Combine's
occupation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Down the rabbit hole" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/04/metastasis_20021.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The island plays host to the usual menagerie of HL2 critters, and
visible at its centre is a mysterious plasma discharge, which Minerva
prompts you to investigate. Clambering down, underground, you discover
the crumbling remains of old WWII fortifications, now housing the
twisted, unearthly technology of the Combine's invading forces. From
there on, things only get stranger and larger by degrees, until the
moment when even Minerva's cool begins to break, and you are left
feeling very much like an ant in a nuclear power station, with little
option but to continue exploring until the exterminators show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's short and sweet - I played through the first and second parts in a
single night. But it's managed with such finesse, extending the
backstory of HL2 in bold new directions, building upon what was
indubitably the greatest PC game of 2005, possibly of all time, with
such verve and imagination that I have to agree with a Metastasis forum
posting: It might just be (&lt;em&gt;whisper it&lt;/em&gt;) better than the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 10/10.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week was full of great artistic experiences, but none so sublime as
these two masterpieces, which I was lucky enough to witness and
complete, respectively, in the last few days. For reasons that I'm sure
need no explanation, I've opted to review them side-by-side in a single
post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/03/nes_super_mario_bros.png"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;: Pushkin's original novel, seen here in the English translation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of Onegin derives from a Russian novel-in-verse, &lt;em&gt;Eugene
Onegin&lt;/em&gt; written by Aleksandr Pushkin over the period from 1823 to 1837.
It was considered a classic of Russian literature, well-loved enough to
be quoted from memory by most Russians. Forty years later, Tchaikovsky
and Konstantin Shilovsky created the music and libretto respectively for
an operatic version of the same tale. This opera was then choreographed
as a ballet by Cranko in 1965, and it is Stolze's 2007 arrangement of
this that is now playing at the Royal Opera House in London's Covent
Garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/03/eugeneonegin-book.jpg"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;: Super Mario Bros. on the NES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Super Mario Bros, similarly, represents the culmination of a
venerated franchise. The character of Mario first appeared as a nameless
16x16 pixel carpenter in the vintage arcade hit &lt;em&gt;Donkey Kong&lt;/em&gt; (1981),
and was then retooled as a plumber and christened for &lt;em&gt;Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;
(1983). The core gameplay mechanics of the Mushroom Kingdom were not
formulated until &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; (1985), but have formed backbone to
the series ever since. Mario has adapted nimbly to several new
generations of home consoles and handhelds, but the most significant
technical evolution came with &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; (1996), which made a
superlative triumph out of the difficult transition to 3D, one that
continues to stymie many of his
&lt;a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/12/13/what-funk-is-sega-in/"&gt;contemporaries&lt;/a&gt;
even to this day. Meanwhile, Mario continues to form the iconic mainstay
character in what is generally recognised as the most successful, and
certainly the most influential, videogame series of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/03/jump.jpg"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;: Flawlessly timed triple jumps result in extra height.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like so many other DS outings, New Super Mario Bros. is very much a
return to form for the champion platformer. It makes solid, competent
use of the DS's dual screens and touch-sensitive technology, and brings
together the highlights of its distinguished lineage: peerless standards
of level design; an endearing levity; crisp, unambiguous graphics; a
roster of nostalgically well-known characters with their various
abilities and affiliations, and of course the pixel-perfect precision of
control that is the very embodiment of Mario. On top of the traditional
2D Mario mechanics, Nintendo have applied their usual expertise,
seamlessly incorporating moves from &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; et al, enriching
and polishing the control scheme, while never complicating it.
Wall-jumps, a ground-pound, and a triple-jump, complete with a couple of
cheerily superficial somersaults. Never has a controller been so
unintimidatingly overloaded with kinetic potential - latent at at first,
but blossoming by the third act, when Tatiana, now grown into a charming
and sophisticated woman, introduces her husband, Prince Gremin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narrative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both works have in common the attempt to convey a narrative without the
aid of verbiage, with significant difficulties encountered in each case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/03/1703471_onegin_150a.jpg"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;: Dumb, as in mime.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballet suffers from an inexpressiveness in this regard, insomuch as the
tools at the dancer's disposal are not capable of depicting much in the
way of nuanced or fine-grained detail outside of particular,
well-trodden areas. Characters may meet, part, or die, and express all
manner of elation or sorrow as they go about it, but there are only a
limited number of stories that can be told from such components. It is
difficult to imagine, say, a political thriller, or even something as
familiar and staid as a murder mystery being told without resorting to
&lt;em&gt;Spandau&lt;/em&gt; ballet. Because of this, the medium as a whole seems to have
become something of a creative cul-de-sac, preoccupied with retelling
the same formulaic stories over and over again - and even these are
considered to be in need of supplementing with a written synopsis in the
program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/03/newsupermario.jpg"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;: Disrupting the narrative direction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, videogames revolve around the participation of the player,
who thus has the means to disrupt any narrative direction or pacing
anticipated by the game designer. Whatever story can be told, must
perforce be introduced either by the forced insertion of jarringly
ungamelike exposition, during which the player is frustratingly robbed
of any real input, or else must be told using the limited demonstrative
repertoire of in-game action. New Super Mario Bros. sidesteps these
difficulties by eschewing all but the most perfunctory storyline, aside
from a grown-up nod to the sordid realities behind Bowser's recurrent
princess kidnapping, hinted at by Bowser Jr. labouring under the
impression than Princess Peach may be his mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall Impressions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their weaknesses, each of these works represents a good, solid
entry in representing the best that the mainstream of their respective
fields have to offer. Two marvellous, vigorous and thoroughly enjoyable
outings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Onegin&lt;/strong&gt;
Rating 8/10.
An education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Super Mario Bros.&lt;/strong&gt;
Rating: 9/10.
