&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Released on PlayStation 3 by thatgamecompany in 2012. Played on Windows 10 in
2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slow-paced opening scenes, alternately trudging up and then surfing down
sunbaked desert dunes, failed to sustain Zander's interest, so I ended up
playing through its short runtime by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways it's an indictment of videogame culture that ten years later it
still feels so fresh and radical to pair players up with another internet
rando, while giving them no means to communicate or interact other than helping
each other out, either leading by example, or exchanging wordless shouts. It
seems like a pretty limited repertoire at first. I'm half tempted to just wander
off ahead, alone, into the endless desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, you realize that standing close enough together recharges each other's
magical flying scarves. Suddenly, it's enough. You cling to each other for dear
life through the howling storms, double back to rescue each other from prowling
beasts, and then fly exuberantly above the sunlit clouds, forever curving back
to seek each other's life-giving sustenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know who the two internet randos were, with whom I shared the first and
second halves of my journey. But in those minutes together, we lived a
lifetime's worth.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>completed</category><category>media</category><category>videogame</category><category>windows</category><guid>https://tartley.com/posts/journey/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 11:22:20 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Subnautica: Below Zero</title><link>https://tartley.com/posts/subnautica-below-zero/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;on Windows, published 2021&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;img alt="spoilers" src="https://tartley.com/files/spoilers.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://subnautica.fandom.com/wiki/Subnautica_Wiki"&gt;Subnautica&lt;/a&gt;,
and its icy sequel,
"&lt;a href="https://subnautica.fandom.com/wiki/Subnautica:_Below_Zero"&gt;Below Zero&lt;/a&gt;",
have perhaps been my favorite
games of the last few years. The majority of their run time takes place under
the colorful waters of an alien ocean. It's been a joy to sit side-by-size
with Zander for tense scuba cave dives, or piloting vehicles through
vertiginous underwater cave systems, headlights straining through the murk to
reveal wonders. It has inspired
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_Below_Zero/comments/r82l3i/birthday_cake_no_spoilers/"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the games take place on land though. I &lt;em&gt;started&lt;/em&gt; drawing a map of Below
Zero's Glacial Basin region just to keep track of where we'd been. To make sure
we visited all the locations, found all the MacGuffins (I'm looking at &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;,
pesky antidote), and experienced all that there was to experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as those goals approached completion, I &lt;em&gt;finished&lt;/em&gt; drawing it because it
had become a therapeutic experience. Happily exploring away, mesmerised by the
scenery, avoiding hostile wildlife, uncovering the ruins of ancient alien
artifacts. Reckoning distances by eye, scribbling down what we found, updating
and correcting the map as we went. Being lost in the experience. Simply a joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_Below_Zero/comments/qutkqz/hand_drawn_map_of_southern_glacial_region_wip/"&gt;Reddit is encouraging me&lt;/a&gt;
to tackle the tricky Actic Spires area, too. &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;Rubs hands&amp;gt;...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows, 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was always going to turn my head, marrying a marvellous geometric engine
to an austere, flat-shaded renderer. Bewildering portals, seamlessly disguised
as humble doorways, are the simplest of its tricks. More pervasive, levels are
wraparound along all three spatial dimensions, as can be seen by the
disorienting arrays of geometry - the current level, infinitely repeated,
offset or re-oriented - marching to the vanishing points, dwindling to infinity
in all directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is no mere trippy backdrop. Gravity can be trivially flipped to lie along
any cardinal axis, and one will routinely step off, into a yawning, infinite
abyss, to fall through the entire level, and beyond, through and amongst the
infinite constellations of geometry, airsteering all the way, to land,
unharmed, anywhere that's exposed to the direction you're falling from. It
becomes a form of teleportation, used to get from A to B almost as frequently
as simply walking around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This non-Euclidean wrapping is baked deeply into the visuals, the engine, and
the gameplay. But for all that technical mastery, the puzzles themselves aren't
as deep and creative and varied as those in the ostensibly similar, but
less technically accomplished, &lt;em&gt;Antichamber&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, there's something entirely appropriate in this. The puzzles
end up being as much rituals as a head-scratchers, holy spatial rites one
performs to unleash the deeply evocative visuals towards the end of each level
- a faceted and angular psychedelic, coupled with unnerving reformulations of
reality straight out of Farbrausch's
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqu_IpkOYBg"&gt;Debris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. By the final level,
this crescendos in scenes reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, profound in
both the intimacy of my commune with godhood, and in my continued inability to
understand what I had achieved. Created a universe, probably? Yeah, probably.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>completed</category><category>media</category><category>videogame</category><category>windows</category><guid>https://tartley.com/posts/manifold-garden/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 03:16:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Façade</title><link>https://tartley.com/posts/facade/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float: left"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://tartley.com/files/2007/06/facade-game.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Procedural Arts (PC, 2006)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;img alt="spoilers" src="https://tartley.com/files/spoilers.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Façade&lt;/em&gt; is an art and research project which aims to extend the remit
of gaming, making a bold raid deep into rarely-explored territory. It
opens with a voicemail, inviting you to visit old friends, and then
presents the player with a first-person view from outside your caller's
apartment door. Stepping up briskly, I was just getting to grips with
the mouse cursor's context-sensitive prompt to knock on the door, when I
began to discern the muffled but unmistakable sounds of an argument
going on inside. The familiar sinking feeling invoked as you screw up
your courage, overcome your hesitation, and knock regardless, is
possibly a gaming first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awkward social situations are nothing new in other media, but the
&lt;em&gt;complicity&lt;/em&gt; engendered by interactivity and first-person immersion
enhances the effect. It's a rich vein, and the ensuing interactive drama
mines it deeply - starting with the knock, upon which a voice fiercely
whispers "He's here &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt;? I thought you said 8 o'clock?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your hosts Trip and Grace do their best to welcome you gracefully, but
there's clearly tension in the air. You can speak to them at any point
just by typing on the keyboard, and navigate the apartment, or mess with
its fixtures, using the mouse. The story that unfolds is highly
dependant on your behaviour, as Trip and Grace respond to you and to
each other, using a social AI system developed specifically for this
project. Consequentially, the storyline and its outcome varies massively
from one replay to the next - although similar themes are often brought
out somewhere along the way: the Italian holiday that no-one wants to
talk about; the 'experimental' decor - a symptom of Grace's frustration
with her uncreative graphic design job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no goals, no score. No explicit measures of success. Judging
by my few replays, the evening can end in one of a small number of ways,
some of them are sad or embarrassing, others, perhaps the more elusive
ones, are happy or hopeful. If the player chooses to adopt the
attainment of a particular story-ending as a self-assigned goal, then
that's up to them - and surely that's the very essence of what
interactivity is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Façade&lt;/em&gt; isn't without its flaws. The graphics are perfunctory - which
is arguably a positive, since it's Southpark visual style steers well
clear of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley"&gt;the Valley&lt;/a&gt;, but
will doubtless repel the superficiality of the mainstream. Similarly,
the AI has a limited repertoire - it only knows how to converse around
particular topics, using the words and phrases that have been recorded
by voice actors. Again though, this has an upside, as the confines of
the two-room apartment, its three occupants, and the prominence of their
relationship problems all serve to reinforce the intensity of the
situation. More pertinently though, even within these constraints the AI
isn't perfect - this is a research project after all. The inevitable
failure to recognise your typed input is often handled relatively
gracefully, by a confused look from Trip or Grace, or an abrupt subject
change, passed off as a deliberate avoidance of the topic you were
broaching - a tactic that sometimes actually becomes more effective and
engaging the more insistent your attempts become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's often-cited in the game development world that the industry is
still not mature enough to know how to write a game that can make the
player cry. The current state-of-the art is comparable to the crude
motion-pictures of the late 19th century. Who would have believed,
watching the grainy, silent flickering of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Ott%27s_Sneeze"&gt;Fred Ott's
Sneeze&lt;/a&gt;, the narrative
and emotional finesse to which that medium would one day soar? For all
its faults, it's in increments such as &lt;em&gt;Façade&lt;/em&gt; that gaming moves in the
same direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 9/10.

By Adam Foster, 2006.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;img alt="spoilers" src="https://tartley.com/files/spoilers.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Title screen" src="https://tartley.com/files/2007/04/metastasis_1_background0000.jpg"&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the digital ink is barely dry on my assertions that videogames have
problems telling a story, when what should fall into my lap but one of
those rare and immaculate counter-examples to shut me right up.
&lt;a href="http://www.hylobatidae.org/minerva/"&gt;Minerva: Metastatis&lt;/a&gt; is a
bedroom-coded Half-Life 2 (HL2) mod that develops a storyline set within
the HL2 universe, a new thread in the tale of the alien Combine's
invasion of Earth. It has been three years in the making, and it's
&lt;em&gt;bloody brilliant&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://tartley.com/files/2007/04/metastasis_10004.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The baseline HL2 gameplay is not changed one iota. Metastasis eschews
the normal stock-in-trade of the mod scene, introducing no new enemies,
no new weapons, no new assets such as bitmaps or sound effects. Instead,
it envelops the player in an enthralling atmospheric experience, with a
compelling backstory and superb player motivation, using a sublime
combination of architecture, geometric composition, intensely creative
injected textual fragments and well-considered use of music. This is
backed up by the superbly crafted accompanying
&lt;a href="http://www.hylobatidae.org/minerva/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, that does its best to
misinform and manipulate, drawing upon the best of various &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game"&gt;alternate
reality game&lt;/a&gt;
influences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Shoreline" src="https://tartley.com/files/2007/04/metastasis_10012.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game opens with your character dumped unceremoniously out of a
helicopter by forces unknown, onto a beach under hostile fire. Running
for cover is the only option. Once out of immediate danger, your plight
is revealed in stages by a series of messages squirted onto your
protective suit's HUD by some agency identifying themselves as
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva"&gt;Minerva&lt;/a&gt;, as in the Roman Goddess
of crafts and wisdom, a.k.a, as
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Snow-Crash-Bantam-Spectra-Book/dp/0553380958"&gt;Stephenson&lt;/a&gt;
would have it, the Goddess of technology. Minerva's communications are
enigmatic and aloof. You are being used as her sentient reconnaissance
tool, your experiences relayed back to her remote location, that she
might investigate a small island, and its role in the Combine's
occupation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Down the rabbit hole" src="https://tartley.com/files/2007/04/metastasis_20021.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The island plays host to the usual menagerie of HL2 critters, and
visible at its centre is a mysterious plasma discharge, which Minerva
prompts you to investigate. Clambering down, underground, you discover
the crumbling remains of old WWII fortifications, now housing the
twisted, unearthly technology of the Combine's invading forces. From
there on, things only get stranger and larger by degrees, until the
moment when even Minerva's cool begins to break, and you are left
feeling very much like an ant in a nuclear power station, with little
option but to continue exploring until the exterminators show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's short and sweet - I played through the first and second parts in a
single night. But it's managed with such finesse, extending the
backstory of HL2 in bold new directions, building upon what was
indubitably the greatest PC game of 2005, possibly of all time, with
such verve and imagination that I have to agree with a Metastasis forum
posting: It might just be (&lt;em&gt;whisper it&lt;/em&gt;) better than the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 10/10.
