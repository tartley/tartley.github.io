creation mentor&lt;/a&gt; suggested that I create
a mod for an existing game, in order to distance myself a little from
the programming aspects of creating a game, and instead spend a little
time considering the gameplay and the art and the music from the
perspective of the user. Sounds like useful advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the last couple of weeks I've been working through the
&lt;a href="http://www.jasonotto.net/tutorials/CompleteTut.htm"&gt;tutorials&lt;/a&gt; for
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DromEd"&gt;DromEd&lt;/a&gt;, the notoriously cranky
level editor for vintage sneak-em-up &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thief:_The_Dark_Project"&gt;Thief: The Dark
Project&lt;/a&gt;.
(Specifically for the sequel, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thief_II:_The_Metal_Age"&gt;Thief 2: The Metal
Age&lt;/a&gt;, which has a
slightly improved engine and editor.) I chose this for three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Released in 1998, &lt;em&gt;Thief&lt;/em&gt; is old enough that the assets are simple
    &lt;a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/thief-ii-the-metal-age/screenshots/gameShotId,7666/"&gt;low-fidelity geometry and
    bitmaps&lt;/a&gt;.
    These are easy enough for me to create and edit, plus if I
    intersperse existing game assets with my own shoddy creations, there
    won't be a tremendously jarring disparity in apparent quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even though &lt;em&gt;Thief&lt;/em&gt; is ten years old and the company that created it
    long gone, there's still &lt;a href="http://www.ttlg.com/"&gt;a thriving
    community&lt;/a&gt; of amateur afficionados, churning
    out &lt;a href="http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?p=1508201"&gt;new
    missions&lt;/a&gt; at
    the rate of several per month, many of which are of exceedingly high
    quality - in some cases exceeding that of the original game. I'll be
    in good company, will have some meaningful feedback, and will have
    forums to turn to when I get into difficulties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last but not least, &lt;em&gt;Thief&lt;/em&gt; is one of my favourite games of all
    time. The emphasis on sneaking around and avoiding confrontation
    suits my sensibilities. Your protagonist, Garrett, is a marvellous,
    mercenary character. Best of all, in &lt;em&gt;Thief 1&lt;/em&gt;, it reveals
    unexpected depth halfway through - the player's expectations of a
    succession of simple heists takes a strange twist when the powerful
    storyline reveals itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having finished the tutorials, this weekend I broke ground on creating
my own level, or 'fan-mission' (FM), in the parlance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Designing a Thief2 Level in DromEd" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2010/01/dromed-sm.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm using the DromEd Toolkit, which is DromEd with some third-party
patches and bugfixes applied to it. My first impressions with DromEd are
that it's very clunky and ugly, and startlingly lacking in
documentation. I've taken to dipping into the configuration files to see
what keyboard commands exist to experiment with. There are a bewildering
variety of binary patches to modify the executable in various exciting
ways, and forum posts about it, although helpful and prolific, seem
fragmentary and rife with broken links. I've still no idea whether I
ought to be using &lt;em&gt;Dromed Delux&lt;/em&gt; instead, nor where I should get that
from. It's a glorious chaotic riot, and it's a little intimidating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, having said that, the binary patches have all worked fine for me,
and the more I use the editor, the more it's starting to grow on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm setting my FM in a museum. There's already an existing museum
mission out there, but as opposed to its marble-halled austerity, I'm
imagining this will be more like the cramped, cosy, wood-panneled
chaotic collection of something like the wonderful &lt;a href="http://www.britishtours.com/360/soane-museum.html"&gt;Sir John Soane's
Museum&lt;/a&gt; in London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So progress as of week 1 looks like this: I've carved out some very
basic geometry to form a stocky museum building. Here you can just about
make out a hole in the brick facade that will form the front entrance.
This is not the entrance that the player will likely be using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2010/01/front-entrance.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all very crude thus far - with repeating textures on large
surfaces, and plain uniform lighting. There are a complete set of mostly
rectangular ground-floor rooms, with interconnecting doorways. The
highlight of my modelling to date is this stairway leading up to the
(otherwise nonexistant) next floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2010/01/stairway.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not so happy with the wood texture I chose - I'll go back and look
for something more uniform. But I am happy with the way the stairs flair
out at the bottom. I realised in the process of creating this that this
makes it possible to fit a flight of stairs into a smaller space than
would otherwise be possible, by allowing the bottom few steps to
gracefully project out into the corridor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having finished this last night, I then dreamed about geometric
operations on three dimensional spaces, which I think is a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Creative</category><category>GameDev</category><category>Geek</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/2010/1/25/creating-a-level-for-thief-2.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jan 2010 19:50:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Cross-site image linking vandalism</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/2008/6/5/cross-site-image-linking-vandalism.html</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="New Super Mario Brothers... or is it?" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/03/new-super-mario-bros2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
