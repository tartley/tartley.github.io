I got carried away yesterday.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's so much to write about the Expanse. It's such a relief to find a
science fiction show with a futuristic setting that is vastly different from
our current day-to-day reality, depicted in a way that doesn't make
scientifically literate people cringe and shout at the television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a wonderful believable
depiction of an entirely plausible future, complete with characters,
politics, in futuristic setting that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On many axes, it's the best SF on television, which is saying something, as
there are so many competitors. Science fiction output is following some sort of
Moore's law of endless expansion. But this is a mixed blessing, because the
resulting shows &amp;amp; movies are often failing to address the psychological need
that prompted their creation. And in some ways, the Expanse is a prime example
of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My SF podcast guy defines SF as the arena in which we forge new myths of
psychological meaning, which are sorely needed as traditional myths, based on
nature and superstition, dwindle in relevance to modern life. The movements of
spiritual atheism and the like are a reflection that even the least spiritual
amongst us recognize that something is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. We use SF to construct mythic narratives, striving against humanity's
current frontiers, to craft tales of personal trials and transformations using
our versions of gods and magic - which is very evidently now science and
technology. The label "science fiction" is a misnomer, as this style of fiction
has existenced long before science was the focus, and it naturally gravitated
towards using science as it became more apparent that science is now where
society's power and transformation springs from, and the name "science fiction"
was then applied post-facto, missing the underlying fact that this is just
mythic fiction with some modern attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Expanse, like many other shows, taps into this desire to utilize the
trappings of SF, and benefits from taking the time for quiet moments of
character work, from Miller's lonely poignant realization in series 01 that
he wasn't the office maveric &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;coupled with a peerlessly "realistic" depiction of a futuristic
SF setting that doesn't make scientifically literate watchers cringe. But it
does so without fulfilling its deeper, more mythical or symbolic obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>fiction</category><category>media</category><category>science-fiction</category><category>tv</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/the-expanse/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2022 19:42:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Battlestar Galactica: Series 3</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/battlestar-galactica-series-3/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/07/starbuck.jpg"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;"It's gonna be OK."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the new "reimagined" version, Dad. I don't really do much
television, and for 2006, downloads of Battlestar was pretty much the
only exception. It's edgy and well-written, and it leaves me
breathlessly excited, and yes it had that lull on New Caprica about five
episodes in, but then it blossomed again, experimenting with one-off
shows, cool ideas, and great characters that remain emotive and
involving while staying well clear of Dawson's Creek. And what a series
finale! Blowing the whole stack of Cylon sleeper agents all at once, the
awful yawning realisation as they each heard the activation signal in
the back of their minds, all drawn to converge on the same room, what a
headfuck, with the psychedelic nebula backdrops all around, to the
rising strains of &lt;em&gt;All Along the Watchtower&lt;/em&gt;, as Apollo discovers
Starbuck is still alive. Hooray! Loved it loved it loved it. 8/10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>fiction</category><category>media</category><category>science-fiction</category><category>tv</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/battlestar-galactica-series-3/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jul 2007 06:27:36 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
