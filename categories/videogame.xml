&lt;img alt="Spoilers" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/spoilers.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't stress enough how this write-up is filled with spoilers. If there is any
chance you'll play &lt;em&gt;Soma&lt;/em&gt;, don't read this! But it's a seven-year old game, so
I'm not holding back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt="Soma - protagonist" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2022/soma-protagonist.webp"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A creepy survival horror game that leans deeply into the moral and existential
quandaries arising from scanning one's brain and copying the resulting conciousness
into alternate receptacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved the setup. A humdrum morning starting at your present-day Toronto
apartment leads to a medical appointment, which requires you to sit still for
an experimental new type of brain scan, run by a PhD, set up in a cable-strewn
side office. Sit in the chair, don the helmet, wait for the scan to complete
and- blink! Suddenly you are elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It becomes evident that you have awoken to the year 2104, and the recorded
brain scans of real humans are being used to animate various robots and drones.
Backups and fall-backs have yanked your ancient brain scan to inhabit an
advanced humanoid robot, in a decrepit cyberpunk base, deep under the ocean,
some time after a comet strike has scoured all life from the planet's surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that weren't bad enough, the base is invaded by disgusting black goo. This
infiltrates electrical and biological circuits, mimicking and improving upon
their functionality. Portions of this host a malevolent AI, and has grown
probing tendrils throughout the environment. It infects wildlife, producing
evil-looking hybrid creatures. And, not least, it has a habit of reanimating
the corpses of the last few humans, who skulk around, not in a good way. As our
protagonist asks, incredulously, "You mean they've been brought back to life?".
Our reassuring AI companion replies "Yeah, let's call it that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game borrows the highly effective mechanics of &lt;em&gt;Frictional's&lt;/em&gt; previous
games, where the proximity of your horrific, shambling enemies cause your
character to experience debilitating symptoms, including, in this case,
static-y visual distortions as your neural hardware suffers from some
interference they emit. This applies even if you simply look at them, an act
which seems to enrage them all the more. So Your only chance to survive
encounters is to stay well out of sight, and actively avert your eyes so you
can't even watch what's going on. This turns out to be fabulously scary and
atmospheric, and lead directly to Susan catching me hiding in a dark cupboard,
staring at blackness for a prolonged period with a peculiar expression on my
face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spurring us along are not just threats to our immediate survival, but also
the adoption of a project, to launch the 'ARK' into space, a solar-powered
simulation hosting the last remaining brain scans of the now-defunct
human race, so that they might live a prolonged period of idyllic virtual
existence, preserving at least some echo of what humanity was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are accompanied by "Catherine", a simulated personality running on our
hand-held omni-tool, based on the brain recording of an AI researcher, whose
project during her lifetime was the ARK. Plugging her in to a wall or console
socket lets her interface with our surroundings, activating power supplies and
manipulating machinery. Aside from that, she provides context, guidance and
motivation, leading you through a series of undersea facilities, linked by
trains, submersibles, and the occasional disorienting trudge across the murky
ocean floor, stirred up by ferocious currents and landslides. I found these
some of the absolute best atmospheric "walking simulator" moments I've
experienced in a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt="The ocean floor, stirred up by currents and landslides" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2022/soma-murky.webp"&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Is that another distant light up ahead? Good luck finding them while the currents pummel you,
and hideous, deadly beasts loom out of the murk.
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, we encounter a few unforgettable scenarios. We find the failing
storage system in which the last remaining copy of our brain scan resides. I
decided to flip some buttons which deleted it, prompting my character to
respond with something like "Let this be the last time I wake up in this
godforsaken place."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At another point, we find ourselves trapped in a few rooms at the bottom of the
ocean, with the gibbering undead hammering on the door from the next room.
There is an airlock leading out into the ocean, but we would be crushed at this
depth. There is no way out. Luckily, Catherine is able to guide us into
assembling a more robust robot, one capable of withstanding the pressure - all
we have to do is sit in the chair and activate the transfer into it. We already
did this once, back in Toronto. Easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, after the transfer, we glance back across the lab at our original - the
chap pictured up top - who, we notice, is still breathing. Asking Catherine
about it, she reminds us that the brain scan is not a destructive operation.
He's still in there, chemically subdued for the moment, but he'll soon wake up
again, wondering why the transfer didn't work. So we are left with the choice
of stomping out of the airlock to safety, leaving him behind to his nightmarish
fate. Or flipping the switch to deactivate him before we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, later in the journey, we finally stumble across an
honest-to-goodness real, live human being. She describes how the rest of them
will be gathered back in particular locations, while she stayed to protect the
ARK. But, we tell her, we just passed through those locations, and there were
no humans remaining there. We both know that the planet's surface is sterile. A
beat passes before she announces "So I'm the last human being left alive."
She's deathly sick, and without hope. By the end of your interactions she asks
you to turn off her life-support before you leave, and stay with her for her
last moments. So this is how it ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrying on, because what else is there to do? We finally we get the ARK loaded
into the launch system that delivers it to orbit, upload our brain scans onto
it just before it launches, and - we've done it! Success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a moment, about five minutes before the end, when I realized what
was going to happen here, even though my character had not. I envied him for
his naive hope. For believing there was still a way out. For, of course, the
ARK's launch changed nothing for us. Our simulations are aboard it, but we are
still sitting here, in a rotting robot corpse in a collapsing facility at the
bottom of a haunted ocean on a dead planet. The copy will enjoy life on the
ARK, but we - like the copy of ourselves we left behind earlier - are stuck
here for good. Roll credits.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>completed</category><category>linux</category><category>media</category><category>videogame</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/soma/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2022 18:51:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Journey</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/journey/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2022/journey-screenshot.webp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Released on PlayStation 3 by thatgamecompany in 2012. Played on Windows 10 in
2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slow-paced opening scenes, alternately trudging up and then surfing down
sunbaked desert dunes, failed to sustain Zander's interest, so I ended up
playing through its short runtime by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways it's an indictment of videogame culture that ten years later it
still feels so fresh and radical to pair players up with another internet
rando, while giving them no means to communicate or interact other than helping
each other out, either leading by example, or exchanging wordless shouts. It
seems like a pretty limited repertoire at first. I'm half tempted to just wander
off ahead, alone, into the endless desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, you realize that standing close enough together recharges each other's
magical flying scarves. Suddenly, it's enough. You cling to each other for dear
life through the howling storms, double back to rescue each other from prowling
beasts, and then fly exuberantly above the sunlit clouds, forever curving back
to seek each other's life-giving sustenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know who the two internet randos were, with whom I shared the first and
second halves of my journey. But in those minutes together, we lived a
lifetime's worth.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>completed</category><category>media</category><category>videogame</category><category>windows</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/journey/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 11:22:20 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Subnautica: Below Zero</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/subnautica-below-zero/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;on Windows, published 2021&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;img alt="spoilers" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/spoilers.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://subnautica.fandom.com/wiki/Subnautica_Wiki"&gt;Subnautica&lt;/a&gt;,
and its icy sequel,
"&lt;a href="https://subnautica.fandom.com/wiki/Subnautica:_Below_Zero"&gt;Below Zero&lt;/a&gt;",
have perhaps been my favorite
games of the last few years. The majority of their run time takes place under
the colorful waters of an alien ocean. It's been a joy to sit side-by-size
with Zander for tense scuba cave dives, or piloting vehicles through
vertiginous underwater cave systems, headlights straining through the murk to
reveal wonders. It has inspired
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_Below_Zero/comments/r82l3i/birthday_cake_no_spoilers/"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the games take place on land though. I &lt;em&gt;started&lt;/em&gt; drawing a map of Below
Zero's Glacial Basin region just to keep track of where we'd been. To make sure
we visited all the locations, found all the MacGuffins (I'm looking at &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;,
pesky antidote), and experienced all that there was to experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as those goals approached completion, I &lt;em&gt;finished&lt;/em&gt; drawing it because it
had become a therapeutic experience. Happily exploring away, mesmerised by the
scenery, avoiding hostile wildlife, uncovering the ruins of ancient alien
artifacts. Reckoning distances by eye, scribbling down what we found, updating
and correcting the map as we went. Being lost in the experience. Simply a joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_Below_Zero/comments/qutkqz/hand_drawn_map_of_southern_glacial_region_wip/"&gt;Reddit is encouraging me&lt;/a&gt;
to tackle the tricky Actic Spires area, too. &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;Rubs hands&amp;gt;...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float: left"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows, 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was always going to turn my head, marrying a marvellous geometric engine
to an austere, flat-shaded renderer. Bewildering portals, seamlessly disguised
as humble doorways, are the simplest of its tricks. More pervasive, levels are
wraparound along all three spatial dimensions, as can be seen by the
disorienting arrays of geometry - the current level, infinitely repeated,
offset or re-oriented - marching to the vanishing points, dwindling to infinity
in all directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is no mere trippy backdrop. Gravity can be trivially flipped to lie along
any cardinal axis, and one will routinely step off, into a yawning, infinite
abyss, to fall through the entire level, and beyond, through and amongst the
infinite constellations of geometry, airsteering all the way, to land,
unharmed, anywhere that's exposed to the direction you're falling from. It
becomes a form of teleportation, used to get from A to B almost as frequently
as simply walking around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This non-Euclidean wrapping is baked deeply into the visuals, the engine, and
the gameplay. But for all that technical mastery, the puzzles themselves aren't
as deep and creative and varied as those in the ostensibly similar, but
less technically accomplished, &lt;em&gt;Antichamber&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, there's something entirely appropriate in this. The puzzles
end up being as much rituals as a head-scratchers, holy spatial rites one
performs to unleash the deeply evocative visuals towards the end of each level
- a faceted and angular psychedelic, coupled with unnerving reformulations of
reality straight out of Farbrausch's
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqu_IpkOYBg"&gt;Debris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. By the final level,
this crescendos in scenes reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, profound in
both the intimacy of my commune with godhood, and in my continued inability to
understand what I had achieved. Created a universe, probably? Yeah, probably.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>completed</category><category>media</category><category>videogame</category><category>windows</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/manifold-garden/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 03:16:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>This Gaming Life: Travels in Three Cities</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/this-gaming-life-travels-in-three-cities/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float: left"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Jim Rossignol&lt;/em&gt; (2009)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gorgeous insider's look at videogaming culture, by an author who,
after an unfulfilling stint as a financial journalist, has built his
life around games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broken into sections corresponding with the author's experiences in
London, Seoul and Reykjavik, it's thoughtful and manages to sidestep the
patronising oversimplifications of mainstream media's gaming coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;Tetris&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Elite&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Okami&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Collossus&lt;/em&gt;,
stopping along the way to examine the modding and indie scenes, the
massively multiplayer intricacies of &lt;em&gt;EVE Online&lt;/em&gt;, and the insane
heights of Korean real-time strategy matches. He knows the best &lt;em&gt;Prince
of&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Persia&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;em&gt;Sands of Time&lt;/em&gt;, by a country mile. He's one of us. I
felt welcomed to his world. Join us - we'll be on the sofa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/10 if you understand that games have the potential to become the
dominant art form of the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0/10 if it's just for kids, innit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="clear: left"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>book</category><category>media</category><category>non-fiction</category><category>videogame</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/this-gaming-life-travels-in-three-cities/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2014 02:31:29 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Legend of Zelda : The Phantom Hourglass</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/legend-of-zelda-the-phantom-hourglass/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float: left"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Phantom Hourglass" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2008/05/phantom-hourglass.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo, 2008&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nintendo spin off a &lt;em&gt;fourteenth&lt;/em&gt; iteration of the familiar and
oh-so-beloved franchise. I'd only previously played the
preposterously-sub-titled &lt;em&gt;Ocarina of Time&lt;/em&gt; on the N64, of which I
retain fond, sepia-coloured memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;em&gt;Phantom Hourglass&lt;/em&gt; to be engaging, and played it to a
thoroughly jolly completion over the course of a couple of months. The
gameplay and plot are a tad more casual and lightweight than &lt;em&gt;Ocarina&lt;/em&gt;,
as befitting play snatched while on-the-go on the handheld platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the DS stylus to control Link is delightfully transparent and
intuitive. Just as for a mouse, however, expert users will eventually
eschew it for many actions, preferring the speed, precision and
tactility of distinct physical buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the down side, some of the puzzles are downright contrived. After
introducing a handy little map, on which you can scrawl notes and
reminders for yourself, the game then promptly takes it away again for
&lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the levels on which it would be of most use, proclaiming 'you
can't use the map here, some sort of magic prevents it.' Right. Up
yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equally intrusive, the dialog is entirely Nintendo-esque cutesy Japanese
schmultz, and it would have improved the game no end for it to have been
entirely absent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such niggles are few and far between, though. Time for another go of the
newfangled rating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: Place yourself somewhere between...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/10 if you're into a deftly executed handheld riff on the Zelda
series, beautifully integrated with the affordances and sensibilities of
the hosting hardware in that way that only Nintendo can do. Lots to love
here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0/10 if you're done with revisiting timeworn ideas, even ones as
compelling and charming as this, and yearn for a resurgence in
experimental originality to kick the gaming industry out of one or two
ruts (such as having a blind spot for crappy dialog.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2009/01/sotc4-300x225.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team ICO, PS2, 2005.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is common for a title released in the autumn years of a console's
lifetime, the programmers at Team ICO have mastered the PS2 hardware,
and wring the utmost from it for this virtuoso performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gameplay consists of nothing more than a series of sixteen boss
fights between your character and a succession of gigantic mythical
creatures, each rising from the landscape upon your approach. Half
stone, half furry flesh, these colossi shake the earth as they walk, and
facing up to them, armed with nothing but a sword and a bow, elicits a
genuine rush of fear, firstly as their size and magnificence become
apparent, then as they stand up, and then, finally, terrifyingly, as
they &lt;em&gt;see you&lt;/em&gt;. Like moments from a piercing dream, playing this game is
an experience that will not be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's in this emotive ability that the game's strength lies, and the
initial adrenaline is only the most coarse example of it. Those disposed
to gallop directly in the hinted direction of the the next objective
would be missing out on large parts of what &lt;em&gt;Colossus&lt;/em&gt; has to offer, and
would be well advised to ease back, enjoy the view, and take some
pleasure from the journey. For fully half your time will be spent
traversing this epic landscape in search of your next quarry, and the
landscape is fantastic, in every sense. Across open plains, rent by
canyons and gorges spanned by ancient, elegant arches, past thundering
waterfalls, though shafts of sunlight across boulder-strewn forest
floors. Cutting through mighty, vine-covered ruins, now occupied only by
lizards and hawks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tranquil exploration is punctuated by the excitement of the
battles, forming a delightful sense of anticipation. The battles
themselves are gripping and rewarding, and provides a enough of a
challenge to stimulate a corresponding level of victorious elation upon
bringing down each of the colossi. Interestingly, as the game
progresses, the tone of the animations and solemn music begin to subtly
expose these victories for what they are: the slaughter of a magical,
unique and irreplaceable creature, leaving the world a more forlorn and
empty place. This effectively leverages the player's third-person
complicity in the killings, eventually evoking feelings of guilt for
your premeditated attacks on your ultimately vulnerable victims.
Reflective of your character's determination, heedlessly pursuing an
outcome that is hinted at in his own deteriorating appearance, you have
no choice but to carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overlaid on this evolving cyclic structure, a delicate narrative is
unobtrusively woven, complete with possibly the most affecting death of
a character in any videogame to date. The story culminates by
exquisitely dovetailing with the opening of the game &lt;em&gt;Ico&lt;/em&gt; (PS2, Team
Ico, 2001), making this &lt;em&gt;Ico'&lt;/em&gt;s prequel (and finally explaining that
game's protagonist's stigmatic horns.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've said it before and I'll say it again. Videogames are a nascent,
immature medium. None amongst us can so much as dream of what they will
one day be capable of. Look upon works such as this as history in the
making, the first time a human has wrought a creative endeavour such as
this, pushing forward the expectations and outlook of the whole
industry, and spellbinding a generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, we're done here. You may leave. Time for me to begin my
experiments with a new subjectivity-proof rating system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: Position yourself appropriately somewhere between:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/10 if you wish to enjoy the state of the art in what videogames as a
medium are capable of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0/10 if you are incapable of appreciating beauty or have no soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FaÃ§ade&lt;/em&gt; is an art and research project which aims to extend the remit
of gaming, making a bold raid deep into rarely-explored territory. It
opens with a voicemail, inviting you to visit old friends, and then
presents the player with a first-person view from outside your caller's
apartment door. Stepping up briskly, I was just getting to grips with
the mouse cursor's context-sensitive prompt to knock on the door, when I
began to discern the muffled but unmistakable sounds of an argument
going on inside. The familiar sinking feeling invoked as you screw up
your courage, overcome your hesitation, and knock regardless, is
possibly a gaming first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awkward social situations are nothing new in other media, but the
&lt;em&gt;complicity&lt;/em&gt; engendered by interactivity and first-person immersion
enhances the effect. It's a rich vein, and the ensuing interactive drama
mines it deeply - starting with the knock, upon which a voice fiercely
whispers "He's here &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt;? I thought you said 8 o'clock?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your hosts Trip and Grace do their best to welcome you gracefully, but
there's clearly tension in the air. You can speak to them at any point
just by typing on the keyboard, and navigate the apartment, or mess with
its fixtures, using the mouse. The story that unfolds is highly
dependant on your behaviour, as Trip and Grace respond to you and to
each other, using a social AI system developed specifically for this
project. Consequentially, the storyline and its outcome varies massively
from one replay to the next - although similar themes are often brought
out somewhere along the way: the Italian holiday that no-one wants to
talk about; the 'experimental' decor - a symptom of Grace's frustration
with her uncreative graphic design job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no goals, no score. No explicit measures of success. Judging
by my few replays, the evening can end in one of a small number of ways,
some of them are sad or embarrassing, others, perhaps the more elusive
ones, are happy or hopeful. If the player chooses to adopt the
attainment of a particular story-ending as a self-assigned goal, then
that's up to them - and surely that's the very essence of what
interactivity is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FaÃ§ade&lt;/em&gt; isn't without its flaws. The graphics are perfunctory - which
is arguably a positive, since it's Southpark visual style steers well
clear of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley"&gt;the Valley&lt;/a&gt;, but
will doubtless repel the superficiality of the mainstream. Similarly,
the AI has a limited repertoire - it only knows how to converse around
particular topics, using the words and phrases that have been recorded
by voice actors. Again though, this has an upside, as the confines of
the two-room apartment, its three occupants, and the prominence of their
relationship problems all serve to reinforce the intensity of the
situation. More pertinently though, even within these constraints the AI
isn't perfect - this is a research project after all. The inevitable
failure to recognise your typed input is often handled relatively
gracefully, by a confused look from Trip or Grace, or an abrupt subject
change, passed off as a deliberate avoidance of the topic you were
broaching - a tactic that sometimes actually becomes more effective and
engaging the more insistent your attempts become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's often-cited in the game development world that the industry is
still not mature enough to know how to write a game that can make the
player cry. The current state-of-the art is comparable to the crude
motion-pictures of the late 19th century. Who would have believed,
watching the grainy, silent flickering of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Ott%27s_Sneeze"&gt;Fred Ott's
Sneeze&lt;/a&gt;, the narrative
and emotional finesse to which that medium would one day soar? For all
its faults, it's in increments such as &lt;em&gt;FaÃ§ade&lt;/em&gt; that gaming moves in the
same direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 9/10.

&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/exhibitions/gameon/"&gt;Game On&lt;/a&gt;
exhibit at the
&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/"&gt;Science Museum&lt;/a&gt;,
back in February,
just before it ended. I was so glad that we did - what a delight it was!
I couldn't believe the assemblage of classic hardware they had packed
into those rooms, all working and playable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write a lovingly detailed description of all the games we
found therein, wallowing in nostalgia and techno-fetishism. But in the 3
months since I first wrote the above paragraph, I've never got around to
completing it, so the following annotated list of my personal highlights
from the first section will have to suffice for the moment, though it is
naught but a gnarled stub of the monument I had envisaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Spacewar! (MIT, 1962)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Spacewar! on the PDP-1's oscilloscope-like display." src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/05/sw.jpg"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Spacewar! on the PDP-1's oscilloscope-like display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just the strongest entry for the hotly-contested title of 'first
ever computer game', but actually by far and away the most &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; of any
of the contenders, featuring a depth of gameplay that wouldn't be
matched until &lt;em&gt;Defender&lt;/em&gt;, nearly 20 years later. A two player deep-space
duel with Newtonian physics, which remains surprisingly playable even
today. About 200 hours of work went into writing the initial version,
which was then refined with touches such as a background starfield which
maps every star from the real night sky of fifth magnitude or brighter,
precessing slowly to display all the well-known constellations as the
game progresses. The Game-On exhibit had the original hardware on show,
a defunct PDP-1 the size of a Hummer, which ran at 0.2MHz. In an
inadvertent demonstration of Moore's Law, a playable simulacrum of the
game itself was provided on a six-inch Vectrex from the '80s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Pong (Atari, 1972)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pong (1972)" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/05/pong-01.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nolan Bushnell founds Atari, and when the local bar reports his first machine
to be 'broken', it turns out to be due to its innards overflowing with
quarters. Before my time, this one, but a clear indicator of things to
come. Interestingly, many of the subsequent incarnations of Pong, for
home consoles and the like, didn't play as well as this original model,
since it was constructed using dedicated analog electronics, which
enabled a rapid framerate, and commensurate fluidity of gameplay, which
could not be matched by software implementations for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Space Invaders (Taito, 1978)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Space Invaders" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/05/wspace_invaders.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triggered coin shortages in Japan, prompting the government to quadruple the
supply of 1 Yen coins. To this day the cultural resonance lives on, as
the French urban street artist 'Invader' is still placing his discreet
mosaics in public places around the world, returning only when local
authorities scrape them off, to put a small white number where the
invader used to be. I was never quite as massively captivated by it as
by other games, although no doubt my parents would protest that was only
because 10p coins were in such short supply for my seven-year old self.
I however, shall stick to my story, that perhaps the blatantly
predictable gameplay proved fractionally less of a lure than other,
subsequent titles that left a little more to the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Asteroids (Atari, 1979)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Asteroids" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/05/asteroids.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clear descendant of the original &lt;em&gt;Spacewar&lt;/em&gt;, featuring deep-space based
Newtonian combat rendered with rotational vector graphics which afford
an austere Kubrickian elegance to the presentation. In common with many
games of this vintage, the terrific bass thumps and distinctive chirps
and warbles of the sound effects were produced using custom analog
electronics, specifically designed for the game. The combination is
dynamite, and Asteroids went on to become Atari's greatest selling game
of all time, tempting ten year olds such as myself into countless hours
spent lurking around the screen edges, dreaming of a high-stakes
lifestyle out beyond the Kuiper belt in a singleship, hunting down those
high-scoring UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Pac Man (Namco, 1979)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pac-Man" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/05/pac.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If computer games affected our behaviour, then by now there'd be a
generation that had grown up running around in darkened rooms, munching
magic pills and listening to repetitive electronic music - oh, hang on."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Missile Command (Atari, 1980)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Missile Command" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/05/missile_a.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game's original design tasked the player with the defence of American
west coast cities, from San Diego to San Francisco, while unending waves
of nukes rained down like fireflies. Cold war tensions made that
scenario a little too chilling for comfort, so the game was re-cast with
a science-fiction setting. The result, with immaculate use of a
then-novel trackball controller, and seismic sound effects, constituted
a classic that remained a prominent and profitable entry in arcades for
fifteen years after its release, and remains an inspiration for modern
games such as Defcon (PC, 2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Battlezone (Atari, 1980)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Battlezone" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/05/800px-arcade-atari-battlezone1.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trailblazing first-person perspective 3D virtual reality, and famously
adapted by the US Army to train gunnery crews of the Bradley Fighting
Vehicle. Myths surrounding the game abounded, of increasingly esoteric
enemies that could be encountered with prolonged play, of continued
progress towards the distant mountains leading to the exploration of
exotic terrain, and the discovery of factories which were producing the
endless supply of enemy tanks rolling your way. In reality, the hardware
was hard-pressed to perform the required 3D calculations for even the
simple surroundings presented at the start of the game, and there was no
more content than could be seen within five minutes of that. And yet,
the stark scenarios it presented blossomed within the imagination of my
young self, offering possibilities for the presentation of limitless
worlds, to anyone who could bring with them but a modicum of
willing-suspension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Defender (Williams, 1980)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Get away from me!" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/05/defender1.gif" title="Get away from me!"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While its contemporaries could often be mastered by careful, methodical
play, memorising patterns, and the occasional bout of dexterity,
&lt;em&gt;Defender&lt;/em&gt; proved to be the ultimate test of reactions, spatial
awareness and hand-eye skill. Once underway, the game becomes a non-stop
roller-coaster of pant-wettingly tense action, as your gymnastically
maneuverable craft, spitting pyrotechnic plutonium death, carefully
rescues fragile humanoids from a sky full of of the most fiendish,
purposeful, body-snatching, god-damned alien sons-of-bitches to ever be
rendered in pixel. Clearly the hatred in me lives on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;End of the Early Arcade Scene&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, Defender marks a watershed in the industry, prior to which games
developers had to go through extraordinary contortions in order to coax
the primitive hardware of the times into producing anything coherent on
the screen at all. As a result, the games of the era were forced to
model simple worlds, depicted using visuals that were highly stylised,
to say the least. To this day I find a kind of beauty in the abstract
minimalism that this required, a kind that, with occasional exceptions,
is missing from games of later generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game developers of the day were more inventors than engineers or
authors. Their creativity was necessarily of a predominantly
left-brained kind, but as is so often the case, in being channeled by
the technical restrictions they faced, that creativity responded by
seeking out nooks and crannies in which to flourish, and then leaping
forth, blossoming in unexpected directions, producing games with rude,
brash exteriors, but nonetheless exuding a rugged and determined charm,
lurching with barely contained excitement from one harebrained idea to
the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defender in many ways marks the culmination of this era. Primary author
Eugene Jarvis' legendary programming efforts wrung incredible results
from the paltry hardware resources at his disposal, while introducing
concepts such as the horizontally-scrolling wraparound landscape, the
tactical awareness granted by the radar, the smart bomb - which
perfectly offset the otherwise ruthlessly difficult play. All of these
would remain staples in the industry for decades to come. Each one,
arguably, an inevitable invention, an idea who's time had come, an mere
incremental development of the exploration of virtual space that nascent
gaming represented. But nonetheless, each one, inarguably, had never
been done before. To bring them all together in a single sustained
creative outburst represented a peak, a marriage of engineering, art,
business and frivolity that had never previously been attempted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1981, just one year after the release of Defender, the hardware
quickly standardised and evolved such that it no longer created such
intrusive restrictions on creativity. The business model had been well
established, the market assuredly huge and growing every year. The risks
and the difficulties overcome, a mass of new game companies moved in,
flooding the market with uninspired, profit-driven efforts and mediocre
imitations. Programmers were relegated to programming, artists and
modellers took over the visuals, and what should have been the central
role, that of game design, fell in the cracks, while the other former
partner in the creative enterprise, the players who had previously
supplied the imagination, were made redundant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't all doom and gloom, however (no pun intended.) In the midst of
the impending '80s game boom, there were plenty of gems, once one
filtered through all the dross. I've found this write-up most enjoyable,
so maybe I'll write some more about that next week...&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>arcade</category><category>exhibits</category><category>geek</category><category>journal</category><category>videogame</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/game-on/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 28 May 2007 17:03:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Minerva: Metastasis</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/minerva-metastasis/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC, Mod of Half-Life 2. By Adam Foster, 2006.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;img alt="spoilers" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/spoilers.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Title screen" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/04/metastasis_1_background0000.jpg"&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the digital ink is barely dry on my assertions that videogames have
problems telling a story, when what should fall into my lap but one of
those rare and immaculate counter-examples to shut me right up.
&lt;a href="http://www.hylobatidae.org/minerva/"&gt;Minerva: Metastatis&lt;/a&gt; is a
bedroom-coded Half-Life 2 (HL2) mod that develops a storyline set within
the HL2 universe, a new thread in the tale of the alien Combine's
invasion of Earth. It has been three years in the making, and it's
&lt;em&gt;bloody brilliant&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/04/metastasis_10004.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The baseline HL2 gameplay is not changed one iota. Metastasis eschews
the normal stock-in-trade of the mod scene, introducing no new enemies,
no new weapons, no new assets such as bitmaps or sound effects. Instead,
it envelops the player in an enthralling atmospheric experience, with a
compelling backstory and superb player motivation, using a sublime
combination of architecture, geometric composition, intensely creative
injected textual fragments and well-considered use of music. This is
backed up by the superbly crafted accompanying
&lt;a href="http://www.hylobatidae.org/minerva/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, that does its best to
misinform and manipulate, drawing upon the best of various &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game"&gt;alternate
reality game&lt;/a&gt;
influences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Shoreline" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/04/metastasis_10012.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game opens with your character dumped unceremoniously out of a
helicopter by forces unknown, onto a beach under hostile fire. Running
for cover is the only option. Once out of immediate danger, your plight
is revealed in stages by a series of messages squirted onto your
protective suit's HUD by some agency identifying themselves as
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva"&gt;Minerva&lt;/a&gt;, as in the Roman Goddess
of crafts and wisdom, a.k.a, as
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Snow-Crash-Bantam-Spectra-Book/dp/0553380958"&gt;Stephenson&lt;/a&gt;
would have it, the Goddess of technology. Minerva's communications are
enigmatic and aloof. You are being used as her sentient reconnaissance
tool, your experiences relayed back to her remote location, that she
might investigate a small island, and its role in the Combine's
occupation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Down the rabbit hole" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/04/metastasis_20021.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The island plays host to the usual menagerie of HL2 critters, and
visible at its centre is a mysterious plasma discharge, which Minerva
prompts you to investigate. Clambering down, underground, you discover
the crumbling remains of old WWII fortifications, now housing the
twisted, unearthly technology of the Combine's invading forces. From
there on, things only get stranger and larger by degrees, until the
moment when even Minerva's cool begins to break, and you are left
feeling very much like an ant in a nuclear power station, with little
option but to continue exploring until the exterminators show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's short and sweet - I played through the first and second parts in a
single night. But it's managed with such finesse, extending the
backstory of HL2 in bold new directions, building upon what was
indubitably the greatest PC game of 2005, possibly of all time, with
such verve and imagination that I have to agree with a Metastasis forum
posting: It might just be (&lt;em&gt;whisper it&lt;/em&gt;) better than the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 10/10.
Bring on the third and final instalment, due later this month...&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>completed</category><category>media</category><category>videogame</category><category>windows</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/minerva-metastasis/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Apr 2007 05:24:11 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
