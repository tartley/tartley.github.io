&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My employer, Canonical, has a "bring your own hardware" policy, trusting that
their engineers would rather choose and administer their own personal laptops,
rather than put up with standardized remotely administered corporate hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current much loved Thinkpad 460p has served faithfully since 2015, but is
showing its age, sometimes struggling under the workload. Plus, its integrated
graphics chipset doesn't have the power to play modern games with my kiddo.
Battlezone 98 runs fine, but Civilization VI (2016) is annoyingly choppy,
at about 9 frames per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt="Civilization VI screenshot" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/civ-vi.webp"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This summer I received the three-year cash-in-hand bonus earmarked as a
"hardware refresh bonus". It's been many years since I've bought a laptop with
the attention to detail that comes with spending one's own money. Even the
current aging Thinkpad was a gift from a former employer. So it's been a decade
or more since I've seriously specced out a new laptop. This post exists as a
place to scribble down reminders of a few things I learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a few constraints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About the same size as the current Thinkpad's 14 inches, or maybe a tiny bit
  bigger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I work on Ubuntu Linux, so I'll need to check it plays nicely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should support modern gaming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plenty of monitor ports, and/or the grunt to daisy chain them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it too much to ask for a headphone jack in 2022?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability for me to open it up, swap out the battery, drives, RAM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3:2 display would be nice, but these are rare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A budget of $2,000 (saving a bit of my bonus for other hardware-related things.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading around, I got sort-of up to speed on components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CPU&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CPU buzz is around Intel's 12th generation (aka "Alder Lake"). These are
"hybrid" CPUs, combining large high performance cores with smaller high
efficiency cores on a single chip. They come in about 30 different variants,
with a naming convention that looks like, for example: &lt;code&gt;Intel Core i7-12700H&lt;/code&gt;.
This consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A brand, eg. "Intel Core"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A modifier specifying a market segment, one of:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i3 Casual use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i5 Multitasking, light gaming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i7 Gaming, content creators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i9 Slightly faster, more parallel cores.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A single or double digit generation, eg the latest is "12".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An SKU, eg the "700" above, a three or four digit number which roughly
  corresponds to the feature-set or performance - larger is better. These are
  only comparable within a single generation, they adopt wildly different
  conventions in different generations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A single or double letter suffix, eg "H" for "high performance", taken from
  &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000058567/processors/intel-core-processors.html"&gt;an idiotic irregular table&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major alternative to an Intel processor is AMD. These aren't the current
season's darlings of the performance benchmarks, although they do include
several respectable contenders that might be great for my needs, as you can see
in the following performance comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Benchmarks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These laptop CPU performance benchmarks are culled from
&lt;a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/laptop.html"&gt;www.cpubenchmark.net&lt;/a&gt;,
sorted by the benchmark score. I included the top 20, plus a handful of notable
others that I looked up along the way. The 'bench' column measures relative
performance under a variety of benchmark workloads which fully utilize all
cores. The higher this number, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of cores is given as (p)erformance + (e)fficiency, for hybrid processors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice my current Thinkpad's processor at the very bottom of this list, which
is 10x slower than the CPU I ended up getting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Graphics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of otherwise fantastic laptops which don't include blazing
fast dedicated Nvidia or AMD graphics processors, but instead only come with
relatively humdrum graphics support integrated with the CPU. Although
integrated GPUs have improved massively in the last few years, this wouldn't be
fast enough to run modern games well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compensate, I considered pairing such laptops with an external GPU enclosure
(eGPU), into which a top-of-the-line desktop GPU card can be plugged. I'm still
wistfully curious about this path, but in the end opted to do without this
complication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a table of the top laptop GPUs, culled from
&lt;a href="https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/"&gt;gpu.userbenchmark.com&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the CPU table,
this isn't the top N performers, because GPUs can get crazy fast and expensive,
so I'm looking for something middle-of-the-pack. It's just a selection of GPUs
I looked up while researching particular laptop models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 'performance' column is the combined result of a variety of gaming
benchmarks, the higher the better. The 'position' column compares the
performance against all other benchmarked GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Integrated. &lt;strong&gt;My current Thinkpad T460.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the two 'integrated' entries at the bottom of the table, one of which is
my current laptop, a full 20x slower than the GPU I ended up getting. The
improvement ought to speed Civilization VI up to around an entirely excessive
180 frames per second. \o/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Laptop models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the above in mind, I read some reviews, and a few contenders emerged:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Framework&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Framework was massively tempting. It brings an entirely unprecedented
- some might hopefully say &lt;em&gt;revolutionary&lt;/em&gt; - focus on user-repair and
upgradability. Rather than soldering and gluing the whole thing together,
all the Framework's components, up to and including the motherboard and
screen, are replaceable using a single screwdriver. This is deeply appealing
for geeks, who want to be able to repair or upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside that gave me pause is it is only available with integrated
Intel-powered graphics. If they had a model including the vastly superior
Nvidia or AMD accelerated graphics, I would have just bought one months ago,
instead of prevaricating. But that complication, coupled with the fact that the
Framework's performance is only mid-range for a 2022 model, put me off
sufficiently to look around at other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dell XPS 13 plus&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dell XPS 13 plus looks wonderful, with official Ubuntu verification, no
less, but just isn't physically big enough for me, and is noticeably
underpowered. And the Dell 15 inch models seem way overpriced, for the spec,
easily exceeding my $2,000 budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;HP Dev One&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HP Dev One looks like a fabulous machine, a colleague just got one and is
very happy with it. But again, it only has integrated graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Mac Book Pro&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I considered this, repaved to run Ubuntu, of course, but to be honest, as
exquisite as the hardware was at one point, it seems somewhat stagnant and
directionless now, fifteen years later. Not unimpressive, but doesn't really
grab me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;System76&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at a whole bunch of other laptops at this point, scouring the "best
gaming laptops of 2022" lists at Toms Hardware and elsewhere. Eventually my
attention was drawn to System76, who, on reflection, should have been folks I
checked out earlier in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oryx is just a few hundred over my budget, even with the current $300 off.
But a tricked-out Gazelle seems to check all the boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt='Gazelle 15" laptop' src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/gazelle-15.avif"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have a reasonably high-ranked 12th generation Intel i7 CPU, which seems
to achieve good performance without wading into the diminishing returns
of pricey i9 models. Same for the reasonably-placed Nvidia 3060 graphics. And
the screen is just magic (judged by my admittedly idiosyncratic personal
criteria.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They support the lightning fast open source &lt;a href="https://www.coreboot.org"&gt;coreboot
firmware&lt;/a&gt;, and System76 are a leading contributor to
the project. They sell with Linux-pre-installed, and produce their own
Ubuntu-based Linux distribution, Pop!_OS (Although stock Ubuntu runs just fine
too.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going with Nvidia graphics instead of AMD does yield a performance boost, but
the downside is that I'll have to wrestle with the opaque proprietary drivers
from the famously uncooperative Nvidia. But in a nice gesture, System76
&lt;a href="https://support.system76.com/articles/graphics-switch-ubuntu"&gt;documents this
process&lt;/a&gt;, and
lots of other stuff, such as how to replace internal components yourself, on
their website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it's proprietary closed source, Nvidia drivers have always lagged
behind AMD's open source offerings in terms of compatibility. In particular,
Nvidia graphics hasn't worked with the new Linux Wayland display server.
Reading around, my impression is that it's not ready yet, but &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be by
22.10 (which is next month!?), so I could stick with the older XOrg display
server for now, without fearing that I'll get marooned there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other downsides. The keyboard is reputedly mediocre, and I wish it
didn't have a numpad. Standard layout tenkeyless for the win, every time. But I
almost always use a USB mechanical keyboard anyhow. Also, with such greedy
components, the battery life kinda sucks when the GPU is on and the machine is
busy. But in the last 12 months, the only time I've run my current laptop not
plugged in is... never? So I guess I don't care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="https://system76.com/laptops/gazelle#specs"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;is what I ordered, with
the 15" display and the 3060 graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I did that thing where I order it with minimal RAM and SSD storage, to
replace with my own parts. So I'll have some screwdriver work to do after it
arrives. The payoff is that I save about $150 by paying market rates for these
components. In fact I already have a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-SN850-Internal-Gaming-Solid/dp/B0B7CPSN2K"&gt;tremendous
SSD&lt;/a&gt;
I can use, leftover from this year's Chia cryptocurrency farming experiments,
so that part is free. This means I can stay within my $2,000 budget, with $9 to
spare after shipping and taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Memory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's generally fine to just buy whatever RAM is recommended by your vendor.
But the most reliable and cheapest memory will often be the slowest, or at least
the one running at a clock speed which is most widely supported by different
motherboards. In order to get the &lt;em&gt;fastest&lt;/em&gt; memory for our particular laptop, we
need to understand a few things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Physical form factor&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current standard for RAM is DDR4. For laptops, the slim physical form
factor is known as SoDIMM. A single circuit board of memory chips is a
&lt;em&gt;module&lt;/em&gt;. A module connects into a motherboard &lt;em&gt;slot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DDR5 is supported by Intel's 12th generation processors, and AMD's newest Ryzen
7000 series. This uses a different physical connection on the motherboard, and
is rare thus far, outside of systems above my budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm looking for DDR4 in a SoDIMM module. Got it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ranks &amp;amp; Channels&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A module contains from one to eight 64-bit wide logical &lt;em&gt;blocks&lt;/em&gt; of data storage
(single, dual, quad or octal &lt;em&gt;rank&lt;/em&gt;.) The chips on a module provide x1, x2, x4
or x8 &lt;em&gt;banks&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;number of chips x chip banks / 64 = module rank
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;eg. Using sixteen x4 chips will provide a single rank of memory on the module
(16x4/64=1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas using 32 x8 chips will provide a module of 4 ranks (32x8/64=4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is sometimes annotated on the module using a notation like 1Rx4, as in one
rank of x4 chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason this matters is that access to ranks is interleaved, so multiple
ranks can provide access to data at multiples of the rate provided by a single
rank. In order to take advantage of this, the motherboard must provide a
commensurate number of memory access &lt;em&gt;channels&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The
&lt;a href="https://tech-docs.system76.com/models/gaze17/README.html"&gt;datasheet for my Gazelle&lt;/a&gt;
says the motherboard has two memory slots, and supports dual-channel access.
This could be fully utilized by either inserting a single dual-rank module
(which is more expensive), or, as in the timeworn heuristic, by inserting two
half-sized single rank modules (e.g. two 16GB modules to make 32GB total.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Clock frequencies and latency&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAM has a clock frequency, measured in thousands of MHz, but "double data rate"
chips transfer data on both the clock's rising and falling edges, so the speed
of transfer is better measured in mega-transfers per second (MT/s), the higher
the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it takes more than one clock cycle to perform an action. These latency
values are sometimes quoted as a series of four integers - the number of clock
cycles to perform particular operations, e.g. 18-18-18-43. But these are often
abbreviated to just the first number, representing read access time, known as
"CAS Latency" (CL), eg. CL 18, which tends to be representative. The lower this
number is, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual performance of the memory is determined by the product of a clock
cycle duration (eg. 1ns at 1000MHz) and the latency number (e.g. 1ns * 18 =
18ns)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the motherboard needs to support the RAM's clock speed. In practice,
the motherboard will negotiate with the inserted modules to find a commonly
supported frequency, the same or less than the minimum of the rated memory
access frequencies of the module, the motherboard, and the CPU, using an
over-complicated and hard-to-predict process controlled by BIOS settings. I
have no experience with this but it sounds well worth avoiding altogether by
making sure we get modules with a rated frequency that exactly matches the
advertised clock frequency of our motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my new Gazelle,
&lt;a href="https://tech-docs.system76.com/models/gaze17/README.html"&gt;the manual&lt;/a&gt;
says that is 3,200MHz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Availability, pricing and scams.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding CL26 latency RAM at 3,200MHz is easy, for around $70. For lower
latencies the price goes up to about $375 for CL16, but that isn't even in
stock anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, after much searching, I found some CL16 on newegg.com:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Memory on sale in Newegg - scam" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/memory-on-sale.webp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is only $128! Carefully checking the specs, including those on the
manufacturer's site, using the shown model number 'CMSX32GX4M2A3000C16',
this is exactly what we want. 2x16GB at 3200MT/s at CL16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While checking it out, I clicked around a bit, and at one point found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bad review on Newegg" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/bad-review-on-newegg.webp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This came along with a number of other negative reviews, stating customers had
been sent memory modules that were fake, ie. imitations of the purported
reputable manufacturer, they didn't work at the advertised clock speeds, and
the seller had gone dark on them, taking weeks to respond to queries, and not
sending replacements until Newegg got involved. Seems wisest to skip this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I found an alternative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Memory on sale in Newegg - legit" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/memory-on-sale-legit.webp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! DDR4 in a SoDIMM package, 2x16GB modules at 3,200MHz and 18CL. The latency
isn't quite as good, but it sounds legit, so I'll take it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that, I'm done. Now just awaiting the deliveries to arrive...&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>hardware</category><category>journal</category><category>linux</category><guid>https://tartley.com/posts/new-laptop-time/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2022 16:59:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Rubik's Beginner</title><link>https://tartley.com/posts/rubiks-beginner/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float: left"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Rubik's cube on table" src="https://tartley.com/files/2021/rubiks-cube-on-table.webp"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never before memorized the complete set of tricks needed to solve a
rubik's cube... until today! My first completion with no reference to my notes
took 3 minutes and 5 seconds. Wine and chocolate motivators as pictured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rubik's cubes first came out outside Hungary in 1980, when I was 9. A year or
two after that, I got my hands on an nth generation photocopy of handwritten
instructions for solving one, derived by a mathematically-inclined friend of a
friend of my Dad. (The things we used to do before the internet!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I memorized the first few phases, so have always been able to do the first two
layers. But the last parts of that solution involved remembering a couple of 15
or 20 move sequences, which apparently ten-year-old me got bored of, or
distracted from, before ever committing to memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that
&lt;a href="https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/how-to-solve-the-rubiks-cube-beginners-method/"&gt;the modern "beginner's method"&lt;/a&gt;
that I'm reading about today is considerably simpler than that, and is
much easier to understand and memorize. So now that lingering childhood
inadequacy is vanquished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Discussion &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/tartley/posts/10159630917927040"&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>journal</category><guid>https://tartley.com/posts/rubiks-beginner/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 04:53:22 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Things They Don't Tell You About Peroral Endoscopic Myotemy</title><link>https://tartley.com/posts/things-they-dont-tell-you-about-peroral-endoscopic-myotemy/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float: left"&gt;
&lt;img alt="P.O.E.M." src="https://tartley.com/files/2021/poem.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The problem&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I was diagnosed with achalasia. It's a rare condition in which nerve
damage causes weak and poorly coordinated swallowing in the esophagus,
including a reluctance of the lower esophageal sphincter, leading to the
stomach, to properly relax at the appropriate moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to difficulty swallowing, regurgitation, and a column of liquid
sitting in the esophagus, which becomes distended, losing elasticity and tone.
The cause of the nerve damage is unknown, and has probably been accumulating
for decades. It's reasonable to assume this is mixed up in some way with
various ailments of my guts over the years (celiac, eosinophilic esophagitis,
chronic hiccups), but causal relationships are unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A solution, of sorts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a surgical procedure intended to allow the
esophagus to drain properly, avoiding further distension. Surgery happens
through a tube down the throat, from where they cut into the muscle wall of the
oesophagus, then tunnel down to the outside of the lower esophageal sphincter.
There, they cut some of the muscle, making the sphincter less tightly clenched,
so that food can pass more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, my symptoms were a nuisance, but perfectly endurable. The main goal
of the procedure was preventative - reduction in future damage to my esophagus.
Plus, there's an outside chance that maybe eliminating that standing fluid
might improve other matters, such as reducing irritation which maybe causes my
hiccups? Long shot, but worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of information given to the patient through the process, but
these are the things that were still surprises to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Day 0. The procedure.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've undergone a lot of regular endoscopic inspections or biopsies. At some
point, in London's splendid Imperial College Hospital, I discovered the cheat
code is to ask to do these unsedated. It's a few minutes of slightly
nightmarish discomfort, to watch a burly gentleman hand-over-hand several feet
of black rubber garden hose directly into your mouth. But the payoffs are that
without any anesthetic, there's no need to fast, the procedure itself is
simpler and safer, and best of all, recovery time is much reduced. Given a
few minutes to compose yourself, you can cycle or drive yourself home right
afterwards, making it a 45 minute appointment, instead of writing off most of
the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, going unsedated for the more substantial POEM obviously isn't an
option. It requires more than the simple sedation I've experienced before,
since apparently there's a phase at the end where they check you're regaining
consciousness and are able to breathe for yourself before they remove the
apparatus that's been breathing for you while you are paralyzed for the
procedure. This is the sort of detail that is kindly elided from the regular
patient briefing, which only came up because we were asking questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only remember coming around sometime after that point, and my first thought,
unplanned, was to test whether I could perform square and cube roots in my
head. Apparently that's my brain's idea of a power-on self test. I could do
small integers, like 27 -&amp;gt; 3, but had the presence of mind enough to see that's
just relying on remembered sequences. I was able to envision the process to do
the calculation for something which isn't a cube, like 28, but I failed to
actually execute any iterations of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said hello to a nurse sat beside me, but resisted the urge to chatter at her
about my mental state. Somehow, even I could see that from her perspective,
that would be like talking to drunk people. So now I'm doing it at you instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while they rolled me into my own room, and stuck a big pad over my
butt. &lt;em&gt;Foreshadowing!&lt;/em&gt; I fuzzily thought. I stayed in hospital overnight, for
tests the next day. Forever grateful for Suze's visits even though I wasn't
the best of company. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hiccups didn't reappear through the first few hours of my recovery, even
though I spent the time propped upright in bed. This is pretty unusual - they
usually return within seconds of me sitting up. But when they did return, they
were pretty painful. What I call "hiccups" is partly a spasm of the esophagus
itself - precisely where I'd just been cut and then clamped and sutered back
together. So I asked the nurse to dial up the pain meds, at first with breezy
British grit, and then with increasingly wild eyes and white knuckles
as they took a while to figure out a few local administrative issues, like
where the person with the keys to the drugs locker had gone. Rode out the rest
of the day in style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Day 1. Restart the line&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd brought a bunch of things for my two day hospital stay, books and media and
headphones and my own cozy pajamas to wear while garrulously socializing with
staff and adjacent patients. That was all a total waste of time. I was a write
off the entire time I was there, not able to muster the bandwidth even to watch
TV. I saw a single episode of Schitt's Creek at one point because Suze kindly
propped it up in front of me, but I couldn't manage a 2nd. I just dozed, and
was wheeled to a barium x-ray, to check I wasn't leaking anywhere untoward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point during this day, my digestive tract started up again. It became
apparent that it had just been on strike, inactive, since the surgery. I felt
it ripple distressingly back into action, along with some impressive gurgles.
The big pad they'd stuck on me the day before turned out not to be vital in
this instance, but I can very much understand how it often might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nurse introduced me to a plastic device for measuring and exercising my
ability to inhale deeply, on which I could occasionally surpass the initial
expectation of 1,000 points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ambitions for the day were to get out of bed and take a 2 minute walk, and
later in the day to tolerate my first drinks, some water and fruit juices,
sufficiently to get approved to go home. Leaving hospital with some
prescription, gluten free, clear liquid pain killers proved to be an impossible
administrative nightmare. Nobody's fault, the system is broken. The concept of
"insurance" for healthcare is inherently dysfunctional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Day 2. Home again&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At home for five days of a clear liquid diet. This means water, strained fruit
juices &amp;amp; drinks without suspensions (i.e. no particles floating in it to make
it opaque), tea or coffee without milk, clear broths. Also, slightly bizarrely,
jello, since it may be eaten while solid, but at room (or body) temperature,
it's a liquid. I demurred on Suze's threat to make jello shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambitions for today were to rise from the sofa for a shower, and a walk or two
around the inside of the house. Scoring 1,500 points on the breathe-o-meter.
Importantly, I now have it together enough to be able to watch some dumb TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Day 3. Outdoors.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambitions today were to take a walk or two around our yard. Scoring 2,000
points on the breathe-o-meter! Yay, progress. Able to concentrate enough to
read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Day 4.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambitions today were to take a couple of walks around the block. Scoring 3,500
points on the breathe-o-meter. I have no idea what my baseline was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Day 5.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First full day and night without any pain killers. Ambitions for today were to
take it easy and not mow the lawn (check!). Might have to get someone in to do
it for us. I'd be writhing in guilt if Suze had to go out and manhandle our
temperamental mower around. 4,500 on the breathe-o-meter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Day 6.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to work - from home, at a desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over lunch I visit the hospital for an x-ray and more tests. I was hoping to
graduate to a soft food diet today, but surgeon says that, although he's happy
with my progress, out of an abundance of caution he's going to keep me on clear
liquids until day 9. Then a soft food diet for six weeks. C'est la vie. Back
home to more apple juice. At least I'm still under instructions to take it
easy, so retain my excuse for not mowing the lawn...&lt;/p&gt;

Dobson (Labour), to present my objections to the Digital Economy Bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the benefit of others also going to tackle Mr Dobson on this issue,
(and anyone going to see some other MP) here's a quick write up of my
experiences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived up half an hour before it started, and there were about eight
parties ahead of me in line. My turn came half an hour after they kicked
off. I had hoped to present my argument pretty much as I laid it out in
my previous blog post. However, sadly I pretty much comprehensively
failed to get my point across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 'I am not a spittle-flecked loon' introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As planned, I started out by saying that I fully support copyright law,
and of the importance of finding ways to ensure that artists get
renumerated for their work. The portions of the bill which describe the
pursuit of illegal downloaders therefore have laudable and important
goals, however I think that the costs and problems associated with
preventing illegal downloads like this are substantial, and actually
make this section of the bill counter-productive. Mr Dobson was an
affable gent, and listened attentively to what I had to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disconnection needlessly punishes more innocent people than guilty
ones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first objection I wanted to raise, because it seems to me to be the
most clear-cut, is that the bill suggests disconnection from the
internet for persistent downloaders. I pointed out that since most
internet connections are shared between several people (families and
housemates) disconnecting a single illegal downloader would also
unfairly affect all the people who share their connection. Mr Dobson's
opinion was that it would rarely come to actual disconnection - the
intention of the Bill is very much that disconnection would be a
rarely-used last resort. The earlier provisions in the bill (warning
offenders for their first 'two strikes') are intended to stop almost
everyone from illegally downloading, without any need for actual
disconnections to take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously I regard that as a grave misjudgement. But I had a lot of
ground to cover, so I left this issue at that. I still feel that even if
disconnection were only applied to a small number of people (which seems
unlikely, from my perspective), it is still true that this would affect
more innocents than guilty parties. There is no reason not to prefer
more conventional punitive measures over disconnection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impossibility of distinguishing guilt from innocence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I moved onto my second point: When monitoring downloads, it is
impossible to distinguish between guilt and innocence. If I download a
song I own, from my home to my office, this behaviour may currently be
legally murky, but it is clearly morally justifiable. To any external
observer, this looks indistinguishable from illegal download. An
observer cannot tell whether a particular download is illegal or not
just by looking at the bits going down the wire - it requires more
context than that. It requires the observer to know which CDs I have
bought, and to what use I intend to put the proceeds (is it subject to
fair use exemptions, etc?) Therefore, along with many illegal
downloaders, the system proposed in the bill will also catch many
innocent people in its net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These innocents can appeal - there is a procedure in the bill for this -
however they will find it impossible to demonstrate their innocence. If
I have bought a CD and ripped it to my computer (which I have done with
all my CDs, many years ago) then when I am accused of illegally
downloading it, how am I supposed to demonstrate that I once bought that
CD?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Dobson listened with patience and good humour to this. However, it
was clear from his responses that while he is a capable man who is
working hard and with the best of intentions, the scenario I outlined
was fairly foreign to his experience. He suggested that the bill is not
aimed at catching people like me who are doing nothing wrong. It is
aimed at people who are making a dishonest living by massive downloads
which they are somehow making money from. I don't believe that any such
people actually exist, never mind that the bill is aimed at them: The
wording of the bill clearly encompasses individuals downloading music
for their own listening pleasure, and deliberately so, but I did not go
into this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Dobson felt that the appeals process would be sufficient for anyone
such as my self to protest their innocence. I totally failed to
communicate that demonstrating my innocence during such an appeals
process would be very difficult. When I reiterated that I could not, for
example, produce the receipts to all the music and movies I have ever
bought in my entire lifetime, Mr Dobson reiterated that the bill was not
aimed at innocent people like me, it would only be applied to illegal
downloaders. I again said I don't see how the ISPs can distinguish
between the two - for example I cannot produce the receipts nor the CDs
that my music came from - I ripped them in 1998, and have since
discarded them all. Mr Dobson said that perhaps &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; the bill become
law (my emphasis), people will be obliged to keep their CDs "in a
plastic bag in the garage", in preparation for just such a scenario. I
pointed out that all of my music for the last few years has been
purchased online - so never came on any CDs to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Dobson didn't seem receptive to this argument. He was still in good
spirits at this point, however, I totally failed to persuade him that
difficulty in distinguishing between guilty and innocent downloaders was
even a realistic possibility, never mind that it would actually be a
serious problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had hoped to move on from this point to demonstrate that this
presumption of guilt that the bill contains will have a severe chilling
effect on people's legitimate and morally justifiable uses of the
internet, and this will hamper the development of business models, which
will be presumptively quashed before ever getting a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Mr Dobson suggested that I should send him the remainder of my
points to him in a letter. I asked him if I could just spend 30 seconds
skipping through the executive summary of the remainder of my argument,
since I felt there was a logical chain of inferences to follow, which
demonstrated some real problems with the bill. He suggested that I write
it to him in a letter instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probable ten or fifteen minutes had elapsed. We exchanged cordial
pleasantries and headed out for a lovely curry down the street with my
awesome wife.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>geek</category><category>imho</category><category>journal</category><guid>https://tartley.com/posts/result-of-mp-visit-i-suck/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 05 Dec 2009 05:23:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Difference Engine</title><link>https://tartley.com/posts/the-difference-engine/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float: left"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, 1990&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick re-read, inspired by a recent visit to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/"&gt;the Science
Museum&lt;/a&gt;, where we were enthralled by
our meanderings around various astonishing artifacts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rickety-looking &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_10"&gt;Apollo
  10&lt;/a&gt; capsule, charred from
  re-entry, having journeyed to within 9 miles of the moon and back
  again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephenson%27s_Rocket"&gt;Stevenson's
  Rocket&lt;/a&gt;, not, as
  I had previously understood, the first steam-powered railway
  locomotive, just a revolutionary improvement in design, capable of
  the unheard-of speed of 29 miles an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson and Crick's original 6-foot mechano model of the double-helix
  structure of a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"&gt;DNA molecule&lt;/a&gt; (or
  at least the original bits of it, re-assembled at Kings around
  1990), constructed between LSD fuelled revelry and Sunday
  afternoons' quiet boozing pondering the meaning of life. Not a bad
  lifestyle, it has to be said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Babbage's Difference Engine number 1, or at least remnants
  of it. This is the arithmetic precursor to his subsequent, and more
  ambitious, analytical engine, the conception of which was a precient
  stroke of genius, the world's first programmable computer. Lacking
  electronics, it was implemented in a purely mechanical manner, a 40
  year labour of which he pursued until his death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised to learn that the failing of the device was not, as I
had previously heard, due to the inadequate manufacturing tolerances of
the time. Recent examinations have demonstrated these to be more than
adequate. Instead, the lengthy and costly extensions to the project,
leading to its eventual failure in an ocean of debts and soured
relationships is nowadays blamed on the project suffering from
'inappropriate management'. Interesting to see the nascent software
industry starting out as it was destined to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was, of course, this last item at the museum which inspired me to
pick up &lt;em&gt;The Difference Engine&lt;/em&gt; paperback again, an alternate history
novel in which the authors indulge the fantasy that Babbage's project
had been a success, and the British Empire, in the upheaval of a
steam-powered information processing era, underwent a series of
meritocratous social revolutions, and as a result was better equipped to
continue its expansion across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating 7.5/10 - a splendid ripping yarn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've always been
intrigued by &lt;a href="http://openid.net"&gt;OpenID&lt;/a&gt;, while simultaneously being
repulsed by the identifiers that I thought users were forced to adopt.
Seeing one too many strings like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://me.yahoo.com/a/.DuSz_IEq5Vw5NZLAHUFHWEKLSfQnRFuebro-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tossed around made me think I'd have to adopt a username like that,
which obviously is never going to wash, for aesthetic and typability
reasons alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately &lt;a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200809/openid_is_too_hard.html"&gt;Ned Batchelder's
rant&lt;/a&gt;,
leading me to &lt;a href="http://simonwillison.net/2006/Dec/19/openid/"&gt;Simon 'Zeppelin' Willison's demystifying blog
post&lt;/a&gt;, taught me all about
how to use your own URL as your OpenID equivalent of a username, by
inserting some HTML onto your web page. So now I've managed to jump
through the sign-up hoops required to get me one of those
globally-unique OpenID username identifiers for myself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tartley.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There. That isn't too painful, is it? Since I got set up, it has proven
lovely to use.

&lt;p&gt;Over the summer I've been keeping a geographic journal of some of our
recent adventures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;msid=114555587615190768594.00044fcb05ec0c0be2012&amp;amp;ll=45.540084,-93.44283&amp;amp;spn=5.809675,14.282227&amp;amp;z=7"&gt;The Minnesota project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;our summer in Blooming Prairie&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;msid=114555587615190768594.000453372a3a9329df229&amp;amp;ll=37.431251,-110.786133&amp;amp;spn=13.158173,28.564453&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=6"&gt;CO to CA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;our summer roadtrip&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an amusing journalling project for me, but as an exercise in
neogeography (the distainful term Geographic Information System pros use
to describe such upstart tools, popular with the great unwashed) I have
to say it's pretty forlorn. The editing tool is thoroughly annoying to
use, and the data model is none existant - you're simply crayoning
one-off symbols on top of the map, with no ability to relate any symbol
to any other, except by manually assigning them the same symbology. The
ability to import KMZ is little consolation if all the resultant data is
so unstructured. No doubt things will get better as GIS and neogeography
borrow each other's best ideas, but for the time being this exercise
left me disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I seem to recall that the editing tools in Google Earth are a smidgeon
better, but still profoundly lacking. Anyone got any ideas what I should
be using instead for personal 'for amusement' projects like this?&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>gis</category><category>journal</category><guid>https://tartley.com/posts/neogeography/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2008 21:31:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Just Married!</title><link>https://tartley.com/posts/just-married/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tartley.com/files/2008/05/wed.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Just Married!" src="https://tartley.com/files/2008/05/wed.jpg" title="Just Married!"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At
the end of March, Susan and I exchanged rings, vows, signatures and
thumbprints on a beach near to Tulum, Mexico, with eighty-five of our
families and friends, plus 'TriPawd', the beach's resident three-legged
dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone for coming all the way to join the party and making
it so special. It all worked out better than we could have hoped - We
never imagined that our own wedding would be so spectacularly brilliant.
The honeymoon in Guatemala was also astonishingly good, from watching
the sun rise over Mayan ruins in the jungle, to hiking volcanoes
overlooking lake Atitlan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've taken photos from a few people, and put a selection of the best of
these online, listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
