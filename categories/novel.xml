&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Kazuo Ishiguro, 2021&lt;/em&gt; &lt;img alt="spoilers" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/spoilers.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was just wonderful to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The near-future scenario is revealed in a compellingly minimal way, teased
in minor details. Eventually we piece together an epidemic of children without
siblings, born into a competitive, authoritarian society. Higher-rank parents
are able to purchase artificial friends, to help with the rigors of
socialization. Klara, a newly activated artificial friend, demonstrates a lack
of experience in dealing with human situations, but her efforts are
unstinting, to understand what is going on within the family to whom she is
sold, and do her best for them. Her earnest naivety as a narrator only
serves to magnify the emotional impacts of the story, as her keen but
inexperienced observation conveys everything we need to know about the
dysfunctions of her tragic new family. She describes
herself as feeling emotions, so the story is partly a discussion of what it
means to be concious, to feel, as the humans around her are forced by
circumstance into desparate schemes that expose the self-protective
aspects of their love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all that, though, I'm not sure what to take away from it. Clearly the
author is very skilled. It seems likely that metaphors are at work here. But,
lunk that I am, I'm unable to discern what they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm fairly sure that the "boxes" Klara sometimes relates her perceptions being
divided into are just stylish flair - a reference to the ways in which her
brain works differently from ours, calving off processing into separate
processors, or some-such, which comes to the fore when she is under stress,
or deciphering complex emotions. I don't &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; this strikingly non-literal
aspect is indicative of any deeper symbolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when I fail to pick up on metaphor, it's because religious
allegory is involved. Beyond tales of mere personal transcendence, my brain
just isn't wired that way. I can see that Klara is in many ways an innocent.
Free not only of wrongdoing, but also of wishing harm, and - being made, not
born - of original sin. On the literal level, this is emotionally
resonant, especially when Klara's heroic contribution to the family is
rewarded by being uncomplainingly discarded, like an appliance, at the end of
the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is this related to the other big clue about things I'm not picking up on -
the title? I'm at a loss of what to make about Klara's relationship with the
sun, which is a central plot point. Was Klara's bargain with her Sun god
literally answered by a special burst of healing light, that saved her family's
child from terminal illness? Certainly that is how Klara relates it. Could she
perhaps have been imagining this? Might the recovery have been fated to happen
anyway, and Klara's association with the burst of sunlight was all in her head?
But the text tells us that the rest of the household are awestruck by the
brilliance and beauty of that particular sunbeam, not just Klara. Later on, the
questions Rick asks of Klara show that, although he does not understand, he has
guessed the significance of the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. Klara the innocent's anthropomorphized Sun god's healing powers are real,
and He answers her prayers to save the life of a child. And I don't know what
to make of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I'm in good company. A quick search does yield intelligent writing
about the book, but I don't see anyone coming up with aspects or metaphors
that I've entirely overlooked - although that is usually quite fruitful when I
search about other books that puzzle me. So I venture that I'm not the only one
who doesn't get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Starship Troopers cover" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2021/starship-troopers-cover.webp"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Robert Heinlein, 1959.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first time reading this classic old Hugo winner. I'd seen the 1995 movie
many years ago, which is clearly a satire, highlighting the fascistic
tendencies of the dedicated military discipline required for humanity to
survive in a dog-eat-dog galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But was that Heinlein's original intent? I don't detect that in my reading of
it. The text seems, to my eyes, to be a straight-up endorsement and
glorification of military discipline, corporal and capital punishment, and
withholding citizenship from people who haven't served in the military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen people argue that, as an expert writer, Heinlein knew precisely what
he was doing, and didn't need to draw attention to his critiques of fascism in
order for an astute reader to realize that not everything espoused by the novel
is necessarily good, or corresponds with the author's viewpoint. We are still
discussing the novel 60 years later, and its relationship to fascism, so he has
achieved his goal of getting us to think about it. After all, didn't Heinlein
write this partway through his drafting of what would become &lt;em&gt;Stranger in a
Strange Land&lt;/em&gt;, which features hippy sexual freedom, and &lt;em&gt;Troopers&lt;/em&gt; itself
contains nods to racial and gender equality (albeit these are somewhat
ham-fisted.) Hence, say some, Heinlein was would not genuinely have intended to
advocate militaristic or fascist views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not convinced. It seems entirely possible that Heinlein was in favor of
sexual freedoms, while in other regards advocating staunch militarism. He
wrote &lt;em&gt;Troopers&lt;/em&gt; directly in response to the US suspending nuclear weapons
testing, which he wished to see resume. According to Wikipedia he stated at the
time that he used the novel to clarify his military and political views, such
as that the USA was too conciliatory in its dealings with China and the Soviet
Union. In the book, the "bugs" - alien enemies, are explicitly referred to as
communist, and depicted as mostly mindless drones, for which the only solution
is eradication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. I don't agree with the author's outlook, and wasn't convinced by the book's
interpretation of civics, and passages of moralizing. But it was an
interesting, albeit naturally dated, read, to see what successful military
SF looked like 60 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Children of Time cover" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2021/children-of-time-cover.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Adrian Tchaikovsky (2015)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of people love this, and it was jolly enough, but it just isn't for me. A
couple of times I toyed with the idea of invoking my new policy of abandoning
any book that isn't absolutely knocking my socks off - something I haven't
previously been in the habit of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unfair of me to compare one book with another, but partly, I was irked by
featuring an alien planet of spiders, that being so reminiscent of Vernor
Vinge's 1999 novel &lt;em&gt;A Deepness in the Sky&lt;/em&gt; (and he can hardly be the first to
play with that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, Tchaikovsky's spider civilization definitely exhibits more
thought-out arachnid sensibilities, whereas Vinge's act more like a Dickensian
family drama - "Button up warm, childlings!" "Yes, Daddy!". But Vinge was there
first, and has such a high profile, being a sequel to a much-loved Hugo winner,
that it casts a shadow on anything else following on the same path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partly, also, I've been spoiled by hard science fiction from people like
Peter Watts - real scientists, who are devastatingly smart, and are not afraid
to dazzle their readers with it, even if that makes it a little hard going at
times. Something about Children of Time was just too easygoing for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="The Buried Giant cover" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2021/the-buried-giant-cover.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Kazuo Ishiguro, 2015&lt;/em&gt; &lt;img alt="spoilers" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/spoilers.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mythical tale, set in post-Arthurian England. Author Kazuo Ishiguro, Nobel
prize winner for literature, is also famous for Klara and the Sun, Never Let
Me Go, and The Remains of the Day (yes, that one about butlers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishiguro moved from Japan to England as a young child, and his insightful
observation of English and Western culture and myth benefits from that
transplant's perspective - at once deeply at home in England, and also
an outsider to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tale is populated by ragged peoples, affected by a pervasive amnesia.
Elderly couple Axl and Beatrice abruptly decide to leave their village of damp,
hobbit-like underground burrows to visit a son they'd forgotten they had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simlarly, other characters are inspired by a variety of classical sources, from
Beowulf to Arthur's knight and nephew Sir Gawain, now old and prone to quixotic
rants - hinting at the subconscious conflict his code of honor has with the
dark means by which he and other knights formerly helped Arthur achieve the
current uneasy peace between native Britons and invading Saxons, now occupying
villages across the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey is perilous, encountering roaming ogres and deadly pixies, not
to mention soldiers of the local lords, and deadly conflicts within the party
itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But any action is relayed with cool distance. Either through the pervasive
mental fog, or using expert fighters' clinical analysis of the minutia of
stance or grip, or by foretelling the ebb and flow of a battle by analysing the
terrain, then allowing the battle itself to take place off stage, only assumed
to have happened, by characters who weren't there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This muted indirectness is entirely in keeping with the ambiguous, dreamlike
style of the book, which is heightened by the sing-song formalism of the
characters' medieval speech, and the narrator's occasional surreal hint of
relating this tale to contemporaries who live in some other, unidentifiable,
historic time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey eventually comes to revolve around the dispatch - or defence - of a
dragon that is said to be the source of everyone's forgetfulness, and as this
goal approaches, vague fears surface of what might be remembered when the
mist lifts. Will Axl and Beatrice's treasured relationship survive the
revelations of their pasts? Will the longstanding truce in the land survive
the remembering of wartime battles and atrocities? Will Saxon resentment at
Arthur's desperate misdeeds be stoked into resumption of the violent war of
invasion? This is left unresolved by the novel's end, but as reader, we know
that the Saxons did ultimately conquer all of England, displacing the Britons
culturally and politically, and probably murdering a good number of them along
the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I'm minded to think of ancient England here as being a root of
modern Western culture, and the mist as an allegory for the bland ignorance of
our own culture's atrocities. The deliberate forgetting, like the mist, clouds
all our conciousnesses, making it hard for us to remember who we are. Why we're
here. The silent resentment of crushed minorities and genocide survivors forms
a pressure, struggling against the placating narrative that everything's OK
now. But, contained, the pressure builds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly a buried giant, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="The Glass Bead Game cover" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2021/glass-bead-game-cover.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Hermann Hesse (1943). Translated from German to English with evident
devotion and expertise by Clara Winston &amp;amp; Richard Winston.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;img alt="spoilers" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/spoilers.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This novel is described by some as the culmination of Hesse's career, for
which he received a Nobel Prize for Literature. Many reviews on
&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16634.The_Glass_Bead_Game"&gt;Goodreads&lt;/a&gt;
cite it as a life-changing novel, or as a singular all-time favorite book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must confess with some sadness that I must have entirely missed the point. I
have not enjoyed it &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;. The number of books I failed to finish in my
life is surely less than five, and this very nearly became one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first half describes Knecht's education and career within the rarefied
academic atmosphere of some distant future European state's "pedagogical
province", wherein (exclusively male) scholars devote their time to
mastery of the titular game. This relies upon drawing deep relationships
between all fields of human study, such as music and biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knecht is talented and likeable, and rises effortlessly through the ranks,
without exhibiting any real volition of his own, other than being naturally
predisposed to study, and having an instinct for drawing out the best in
people. He is ultimately assigned to the highest office in the land, without
encountering any substantive antagonist or difficulty along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanics of the game itself, about which all this ostensibly revolves, is
deliberately never explained, other than poetic references to glass beads
being used to exquisitely interrelate insights or concepts from multiple fields
of study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first half of the book bored me to absolute tears. If I had to find a
single word to describe Knecht, despite his diligence, it would be "inactive".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the halfway point through the book, this serenity is interrupted by
Knecht making the controversial decision to quit, not just from his exalted
post, but from the whole system over which it rules. He leaves the insular
academic province entirely, to begin a new life, subject to more real-world
constraints. Just at this very moment, as the narrative becomes interesting,
this section abruptly ends in a very unexpected manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the whole book, this moment resonates with me. Knecht has spent a life
devoted to scholarly thought, but after many decades he throws off the
expectations of that life to forge his own path. Mere days after that decision,
a moment of physical exertion proves to be his sudden undoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this show that Knecht should have more highly valued the protections from
the physical world that his intellectual castle provided? That someone raised
in such a cosseted environment was unsuitable to face the rigors of the real
world? Or should I instead observe that, despite his ostensible success and
satisfaction with life, in waiting so long before daring to strike out on his
own, and then find days later that his time was up, Knecht has in some ways
wasted his life doing something other than what he really wanted to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither of these seem particularly compelling to me, nor sufficient for
the larger themes that I suspect the book might actually be grappling with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second half of the book contains various poems, written by Knecht when he
was younger, containing premonitions of his aspirations and his doubts. It ends
with three short tales, each describing an alternate life that Knecht might
have lived in other times. Apparently early drafts had these tales being
literal other lives Knecht was reincarnated into. But in the published book,
they are presented without context, and I think it is only by consensus
that they are commonly understood to be grouped with the earlier poems as
examples of Knecht's writing - his imagination of other lives he might have
lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not understand the relevance of these tales to the larger portion of
the book, other than the way they forcefully contrast with it, by immersing
Knecht in emotional and painful tales of life embedded within a wider society,
rather than abstractly observing its achievements from without. As such,
they force him into action, and to me they are more engaging for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia informs me that each of the four tales of Knecht's life focuses on a
different basic aspect of analytical psychology: thinking (Magister Ludi),
sensation (The Rainmaker), intuition (Indian life) and feeling (The Father
Confessor). Similarly, several of the book's characters who had influence on
Knecht are thinly-veiled references to real world people, some famous such
as Friedrich Nietzsche, others being acquaintances of the author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of which seems reasonable, but doesn't really help me understand what I
just read. Perhaps each tale of Knecht, in focussing on one human trait,
is lacking because it undervalues the other three. Perhaps. Â¯\&lt;em&gt;(ã)&lt;/em&gt;/Â¯&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>book</category><category>fiction</category><category>media</category><category>novel</category><category>science-fiction</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/the-glass-bead-game-by-hermann-hesse-1943/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 18:37:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Fine Structure, by qntm</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/fine-structure-by-qntm/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float: left"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another fabulously enjoyable science fiction adventure from qntm. Like their
other novels, it does a tremendous job of exploring the implications and
consequences of big science fiction concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, it's a story of human superheroes, whose powers derive from
beings-beyond-comprehension, from the high-dimensional multiverse, the
Structure, within which our paltry three-plus-one space-time is naught but an
embedded decal. Their struggles rewrite the fundamental physics of our
universe, to fashion it into an inescapable trap, denying humanity access to
advanced sciences, and to communion with the higher levels of the Structure.
Loved it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought all four of &lt;a href="https://qntm.org/fiction"&gt;qntm's books&lt;/a&gt;
when I discovered the fantastic
&lt;a href="https://www.tartley.com/posts/there-is-no-antimemetics-division/"&gt;There is no Antimemetics Division&lt;/a&gt;.
I didn't really expect to like all of them, sight unseen, but was delighted to
support an emerging author who had contributed to the genius of SCP. But then
the books that arrived turned out to be bloody brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one tells a tale in which magic was discovered to be real in the 1970s,
becoming a new, arcane branch of physics. From there, it piles on the twists
and raises the stakes at an enthralling and dizzying rate, demanding the
reader to keep up through many exciting layered reveals and escalating changes
of perspective. Absolutely smashing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;em&gt;Antimemetics&lt;/em&gt;, it scores points with me for including some female heroes,
who surmount challenges through some striking strengths of character &amp;amp;
expertise, rather than simply being the best at applied violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Steven King, 2011&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompted by a conversation at work about favorite time travel stories,
I snagged this from the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;English school teacher Jake is roped into a dying man's plot to exploit a
mechanism of travelling back to 1958, from which, with many complications, he
waits out the intervening few years in order to prevent JFK's assassination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it a page turner, certainly. But nonetheless I was slightly
disappointed, perhaps because of my reverence for such a successful author, who
I haven't actually read since my teens. Expectations of mastery clashed with
what, for me, felt like lowest-common-denominator style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King knows exactly what he intends - to use time travel as a hook on which to
hang a human tale of drama, aspiration and loss. He has no interest in my
personal predilections, such as messing with the logical conundrums of his
chosen time-travel mechanic, and he declares this straightforwardly. When the
main character asks "But what if I end up killing my own Grandfather?", his
mentor shoots him a look of incomprehension, replying "Why in hell would you
want to do a thing like that?" Subject closed, and fair enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by qntm, 2020&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;img alt="spoilers" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/spoilers.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first became aware of this book when I noticed that the good folks over
at &lt;a href="http://www.scpwiki.com/"&gt;The SCP Foundation&lt;/a&gt; have kept themselves busy in
the years since I last looked over their peerless and endlessly enthralling
wiki of dry and tantalizing protocols with which to "Secure, Contain, and
Protect" a catalog of creepy anomalous artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the arcs to break the churning surface of that crowd-sourced
fictional milieu is that of the
&lt;a href="http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/antimemetics-division-hub"&gt;Antimemetics Division&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"An antimeme is an idea which, by its intrinsic nature, discourages people
from spreading it. Think of ideas that you wouldn't share - passwords,
taboos, shameful secrets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anomalous antimemes are another matter entirely. How do you contain
something you can't record, or remember? How do you fight an enemy when you
can never even know you're at war?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to the Antimemetics Division.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, this is not your first day."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrigued, I started clicking around, and as is the way of SCP, discovered
many hours had passed. Shortly afterwards, I realized the arc has been
collected into this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasional SCP entries, in the format we know and love, intertwine a short but
intense tale of memetic hazards, populated by a few of the Division's
finest - those rare individuals who can go from the standing start of a hint
that their memories can't be trusted, to a well-executed plan based upon
a stack of assumptions about what might be needed, and what might already have
been done that they can count upon, even though they no longer remember any of
it, without ever retaining any knowledge of their situation, or what they're up
against. I don't think I've ever been so impressed by the sheer depth of a
character's resourcefulness and initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey does contain world-ending hellscapes, with some gore, which might
not be everyone's cup of tea. But it's short and somehow manages to stay light
in tone, so isn't emotionally arduous on that front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably my favorite fiction of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those like me with an epub fetish,
you can buy &lt;em&gt;There is No Antimememtics Division&lt;/em&gt; in many formats,
including Amazon links, EPUBs, or free-to-read online,
&lt;a href="https://qntm.org/scp"&gt;at the author's site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
