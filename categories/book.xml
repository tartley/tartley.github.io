&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Chris DeLeon (2018)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roman Emperor Marcus Auralias' notes, traditionally titled &lt;em&gt;Meditations&lt;/em&gt;,
are a foundational text for practical Stoicism. They comprise a multitude of
observations and recommendations, grouped into sections such as "Keeping
thoughts tranquil", and "Cooperation, collaberation and contribution". They
offer advice for living a contented life, with less regret, sorrow, anger and
fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several translations exist, themselves dated from through the ages. This book
combines them, to synthesize a text which doesn't hew as precisely to the
original as a straight translation might, but is instead intended to have the
most relevance to modern ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confession: It's taken me &lt;em&gt;months&lt;/em&gt; to get through it. Partly this is because
I've allowed myself to be distracted by more gaudy and immediate books along
the way. Partly it's because I found the best way to read this was &lt;em&gt;slowly&lt;/em&gt;.
Practically every paragraph is worth reflecting upon, to consider how it
applies to my own life, and ponder what practical, specific next steps are
implied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to criticize, it would only be the superficial wrinkle that there's
a lot of repetition, such as hundreds of suggestions to not fear death.
Apparently the original documents were accumulated over decades of Auralias'
life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genuinely life changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompted by a conversation at work about favorite time travel stories,
I snagged this from the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;English school teacher Jake is roped into a dying man's plot to exploit a
mechanism of travelling back to 1958, from which, with many complications, he
waits out the intervening few years in order to prevent JFK's assassination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it a page turner, certainly. But nonetheless I was slightly
disappointed, perhaps because of my reverence for such a successful author, who
I haven't actually read since my teens. Expectations of mastery clashed with
what, for me, felt like lowest-common-denominator style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King knows exactly what he intends - to use time travel as a hook on which to
hang a human tale of drama, aspiration and loss. He has no interest in my
personal predilections, such as messing with the logical conundrums of his
chosen time-travel mechanic, and he declares this straightforwardly. When the
main character asks "But what if I end up killing my own Grandfather?", his
mentor shoots him a look of incomprehension, replying "Why in hell would you
want to do a thing like that?" Subject closed, and fair enough.&lt;/p&gt;
