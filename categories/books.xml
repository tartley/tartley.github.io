&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a few pages to shift gears to match the provocatively casual style,
but once I did, it quickly became an engrossing and endearing read.
The book collects a series of tiny but grand adventures, each riffing on one
of the titular Ed's fabulous new inventions or discoveries. Together these
form an arc which burns through combinations of high-concept SF ideas at an
unseemly rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reminded me of what I've fondly said about 200AD (the galaxy's greatest
comic), that somehow the superficiality of the medium allows
writers to experiment more wildly with form and content, throwing up a torrent
of creativity which, while sometimes uneven, generates moments of sheer
brilliance. I thought being a comic was an essential part of that formula. But
&lt;em&gt;Ed&lt;/em&gt; proves me wrong by achieving the same velocity of verve and vigor,
rendered in prose. A delight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those like me with an epub fetish, you can buy &lt;em&gt;Ed&lt;/em&gt; in many formats,

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought all four of &lt;a href="https://qntm.org/fiction"&gt;qntm's books&lt;/a&gt;
when I discovered the fantastic
&lt;a href="https://www.tartley.com/posts/there-is-no-antimemetics-division/"&gt;There is no Antimemetics Division&lt;/a&gt;.
I didn't really expect to like all of them, but was delighted to support an
emerging author who had contributed to the genius of SCP. But then the books
that arrived turned out to be bloody brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one tells a tale in which magic was discovered to be real in the 1970s,
becoming a new, arcane branch of physics. From there, it piles on the twists
and raises the stakes at an enthralling and dizzying rate, demanding the
reader to keep up through many exciting layered reveals and escalating changes
of perspective. Absolutely smashing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;em&gt;Antimemetics&lt;/em&gt;, it scores points with me for including some female heroes,
who surmount challenges through some striking strengths of character &amp;amp;
expertise, rather than simply being the best at applied violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="There is No Antimemetics Division cover" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2021/there-is-no-antimemetics-division-cover.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first became aware of this book when I noticed that the good folks over
at &lt;a href="http://www.scpwiki.com/"&gt;The SCP Foundation&lt;/a&gt; have kept themselves busy in
the years since I last looked over their peerless and endlessly enthralling
wiki of dry and tantalizing protocols with which to "Secure, Contain, and
Protect" a catalog of creepy anomalous artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the arcs to break the churning surface of that crowdsourced
fictional millieu is that of the
&lt;a href="http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/antimemetics-division-hub"&gt;Antimemetics Division&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"An antimeme is an idea which, by its intrinsic nature, discourages people
from spreading it. Think of ideas that you wouldn't share - passwords,
taboos, shameful secrets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anomalous antimemes are another matter entirely. How do you contain
something you can't record, or remember? How do you fight an enemy when you
can never even know you're at war?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to the Antimemetics Division.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, this is not your first day."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intruiged, I started clicking around, and as is the way of SCP, discovered
many hours had passed. Shortly afterwards, I realized the arc has been
collected into this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasional SCP entries, in the format we know and love, intertwine a short but
intense tale of memetic hazards, populated by a few of the Division's
finest - those rare individuals who can go from the standing start of a hint
that their memories can't be trusted, to a well-executed plan based upon
a stack of assumptions about what might be needed, and what might already have
been done that they can count upon, even though they no longer remember any of
it, without ever retaining any knowledge of their situation, or what they're up
against. I don't think I've ever been so impressed by the sheer depth of a
character's resourcefulness and initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey does contain world-ending hellscapes, with some gore, which might
not be everyone's cup of tea. But it's short and somehow manages to stay light
in tone, so isn't emotionally arduous on that front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably my favorite fiction of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float: left"&gt;
&lt;img alt="The Structure of Scientific Revolutions cover" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2020/the-structure-of-scientific-revolutions-cover.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Thomas S. Kuhn, 1962.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved &lt;em&gt;The Structure of Scientfic Revolutions&lt;/em&gt;.
It was recommended to me as having similar impact to undergraduate
classics like &lt;em&gt;Godel, Escher, Bach&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;The Blind Watchmaker.&lt;/em&gt; I'm going
to just summarize the content here, so: Spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It begins by observing that discredited scientific theories, even those
which seem laughable today, such as phrenology, or the Ptolemaic model of the
heavens, were not crackpot theories with shaky evidence. Earnest, hardworking
practitioners refined them using sensible processes, which by the 17th century
were converging on the modern scientific method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process of "normal" science excels at the incremental refinement of
established scientific theories. But in practice, is unable to perform the
revolutionary transitions required to overcome outmoded theories and replace
them with others, no matter how bizarre and wrongheaded the initial theory
looks to us now with hindsight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is the unarticulated process that is responsible for these
transitions, i.e. how do scientific revolutions happen? We have intuitive
visions of this occurring overnight. An individual experiment yields unexpected
results, contradicting conventional theory, while irrefutably supporting an
alternate theory to take its place. But in practice, this &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, and often for years or centuries, no discrepancy between theory and
experiment is noticed, because the prevailing theories of the time have a
massive shaping effect on what questions it is valid to ask, what experiments
are deemed useful to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For practitioners to turn their backs on an established theory in such a time
is never productive. They are shunned for turning their backs on science
itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see this vividly today with homeopaths (my own example, not the book's).
Often, and incorrectly, homeopathy is mocked because the theories sound
ridiculous to one steeped in a conventional understanding of chemistry.
People will jeer at how total dilution can 'obviously' have no effect,
or at the idea of water exhibiting some sort of 'memory'. But such jeering is
as scientifically illiterate as the quacks it contends with. The argument from
personal incredulity has no place in determining scientific truth. No newer
theory makes sense in the light of the more limited, and often contradictory,
paradigm that it eventually replaces. The only useful criteria is to try it
out. &lt;em&gt;Does it actually work?&lt;/em&gt; This is the axis upon which homeopathy should be
judged. (and upon which it has decisively been found wanting.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All contradictions to conventional science suffer a similar ignominious
treatment, regardless of how right they might later turn out to be. Before any
revolution of theory can overturn conventional understanding, the stage
must be set, the community prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process begins as the incremental advances of "normal" science gradually
increase the scope and precision of accepted theories. Until this point,
measurements in which experiment does not conform to theory are either ignored
as erroneous artifacts, or are dismissed as indicative of some separate,
unknown phenomena. They are never interpreted to mean prevailing theory is
wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However the growing scope &amp;amp; precision of theory and measurement gradually
uncovers more of these discrepancies, or reveals them in finer detail.
Eventually they become too prominent to ignore, and a kind of phase transition
occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the discrepancies become so prominent and concerning that they
are judged to be a valid area of study in themselves, rather than just annoying
aberrations. Leading practitioners devote themselves to the task. Foundations
of the specialisation that were once accepted without question now come under
scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To partially explain the discrepancies, people introduce many incompatible
variations on current theories. The once unified field divides into cliques,
supporting different theoretical variations. The field, formerly a united mass,
calves into fragments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one of these variations on existing theory manages to explain all
observations, then this gradually gains mindshare, until the whole community
has migrated to this new, incrementally improved theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in cases where a truly revolutionary change is required, such
incrementalism is insufficient, and none of the theoretical variations are
fully successful in explaining all observations. The factions' differing
underlying assumptions give them no common ground upon which to arbitrate their
differences, so their debates are irreconcilable. The fragments are melting,
into a churning liquid of disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This state is notably similar to the state of a nascent field before any
established scientific theories have taken hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All is chaos, with different groups supporting different ideas, agreeing on
nothing. The field is in turmoil, its practitioners in genuine emotional
distress. Their personal identities are undermined. What does it mean to be a
practitioner when nobody can agree on what the field even is? Is what we do
even &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt; at all? A crisis has arrived. We are at boiling point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuhn compares this to individuals in psychological experiments, given cunningly
contradictory sensual stimuli. At first they don't notice anything wrong about
a brief glimpse of a playing card showing a red king of clubs. As the length of
their glimpse expands, and the stimulation becomes more intrusive, the subject
starts to hesitate, and stumble on words. Suddenly it impinges on their
consciousness, and they cry out, distressed, uncertain of even basic facts. "My
God! What did I see? Are clubs always red? What's happening here?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuhn also compares scientific revolutions to their social and political
counterparts, in a chillingly familiar passage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Political revolutions aim to change political institutions in ways that
those institutions themselves prohibit. Their success therefore necessitates
the partial relinquishment of one set of institutions in favor of another, and
in the interim society is not fully governed by institutions at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially it is crisis alone that attenuates the role of political
institutions [...] In increasing numbers, individuals become increasingly
estranged from political life, and behave more &amp;amp; more eccentrically within
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, as the crisis deepens, many individuals commit themselves to [...] some
new institutional framework. At that point, society is divided into competing
camps or parties, one seeking to defend the old institutional constellation,
others seeking to institute some new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once that polarization has occurred, &lt;em&gt;political recourse fails&lt;/em&gt;. Because
they differ about the political matrix within which political change is to be
achieved and evaluated, and acknowledge no common supra-institutional framework
for adjudication of differences, the parties to a revolutionary conflict must
finally resort to the techniques of mass persuasion, often including force."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any point, the &lt;em&gt;boldest&lt;/em&gt; practitioners, often those with least invested in
the previous status quo, such as the relatively young, or those entering from
adjacent fields, will introduce strikingly different sets of theories. But only
now that the stage is set, amongst such distressing chaos, is the community
ready to entertain truly revolutionary ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, one of these new ideas will succeed in explaining all the
observations, but in order to do so, it requires incommensurable changes in the
underlying philosophy of the field, from the axiomatic definitions, to the set
of questions that are valid to ask. One can no longer ask, of a spherical
Earth, "What happens if you fall off?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, many revolutionary changes are not an unalloyed good. Gains in
explicative power in one area are often balanced by losses elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in evolution, the new theory is not necessarily more &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt;, so much as
it is a better fit for the current circumstances, i.e. providing greater
predictive power in an area that is currently pertinent. Maybe scientific
progress is more obviously useful to society in that area, or instruments are
more capable of making measurements in that area. The two often coincide,
since influences are are unable to detect or manipulate are also unlikely to
be of much direct use to society. So as the social and technological context
evolves, so does the relative fitness of potential competing paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody understands this trade-off more deeply than the field's most
invested practitioners, who feel the losses of losing the old model most
keenly, and therefore may resist the new paradigm for the remainder of their
careers. The new paradigm will not achieve total dominance until the field is
populated by a whole new generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am reminded of the dark priesthood of command-line programmers, although
I note with no little joy that our merry band includes some of the best and
brightest of the next generation (as judged by my own paradigm's criteria.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Swamp Thing cover" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2019/06/swamp-thing-vol-1.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Alan Moore, Jogn Totleben, &amp;amp; Steve Bissette&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moore's deconstruction of existing characters continues. Originally Swamp Thing
was Alec Holland, miraculously transformed by an infusion of artificially
stimulated plant matter. When Alan Moore takes over the writing, Swamp Thing's
ostracization and existential dread is compounded by the discovery that this
origins story has been a delusion all along. Alec Holland was killed outright
in the accident, and an accumulation of plant matter grew around his decaying
form, integrating the physical remains of his memories into a creature that
yearned to recapture its human form, but was never human in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Miracleman cover" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2019/06/miracleman.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Alan Moore, Alan Davies, &amp;amp; John Totleben.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a little time digging out earlier works of Alan Moore. These
inter-library loans didn't disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally published as &lt;em&gt;Marvelman&lt;/em&gt; by Mick Anglo, from
1954-59. Legal battles rebranded the character as &lt;em&gt;Miracleman&lt;/em&gt; in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening pages reprint one of those campy early stories, involving
primary-colored moralizing while flying around to punch time-travelling Nazi
super-scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then continue with Alan Moore's postmodern 1980s reboot. This recasts the
simplistic tales of the original period as a placating dream, fed to a captured
Miracleman by his nemesis. His hokey origins story is similarly re-ploughed. The
ensuing tales are dark and introspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thread follows the emotional stresses placed on Miracleman when incarnated
as his human alter-ego, the frail and fallible half of a godlike being. He's
unable to conceive a child with his wife, although &lt;em&gt;Miracleman&lt;/em&gt; can, and
succumbs to self-loathing and jealousy, culminating in a touching scene in
which he climbs a mountain, leaves a forlorn monument, and changes into
Miracleman one last time, never to change back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is more uneven than Moore's later works. Yes, it's unashamedly an
underwear-on-the-outside superhero story. But nonetheless I loved it, and
scenes like the above stayed with me for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also this month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Atrocity Archive&lt;/strong&gt; by Charles Stross. The conceit of Lovecraftian horror
rationalized to a mathematical or computable topic is appealing to me, and
kept the pages turning, but I didn't ultimately find it life-changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nightwings&lt;/strong&gt; by Robert Silverberg. A fantastical far-future tale of humanity
split into occupational castes, guarding the world against prophesied
invasion. Not my thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Greg Bear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A smashing hard SF tale, about the existential mystery of life aboard a
generation starship that has lost its way. Following in the footsteps of
classic variations, such as &lt;em&gt;Non-Stop&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Methusalah's Children&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tau
Zero&lt;/em&gt;, it centers around the character's revelations as they uncover their
situation and origins, being decanted to order by warring factions amongst
high technology ruins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Jim Rossignol&lt;/em&gt; (2009)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gorgeous insider's look at videogaming culture, by an author who,
after an unfulfilling stint as a financial journalist, has built his
life around games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broken into sections corresponding with the author's experiences in
London, Seoul and Reykjavik, it's thoughtful and manages to sidestep the
patronising oversimplifications of mainstream media's gaming coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;Tetris&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Elite&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Okami&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Collossus&lt;/em&gt;,
stopping along the way to examine the modding and indie scenes, the
massively multiplayer intricacies of &lt;em&gt;EVE Online&lt;/em&gt;, and the insane
heights of Korean real-time strategy matches. He knows the best &lt;em&gt;Prince
of&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Persia&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;em&gt;Sands of Time&lt;/em&gt;, by a country mile. He's one of us. I
felt welcomed to his world. Join us - we'll be on the sofa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/10 if you understand that games have the potential to become the

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Ivar Jacobsen&lt;/em&gt; (1992, 4th revision)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might wonder if there's anything left to say about
object-orientation that hasn't already been discussed to death. I was
led to this 1992 book by Uncle Bob's talk "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkDN78P884"&gt;Architecture: The Lost
Years&lt;/a&gt;." In it Bob posits
that in the 1990s, just as people like Ivar were completing their
20-year journey of figuring out some fairly optimal ways to do
object-orientation, along came the disruptive influence of the web,
which turned everyone's priorities, methodologies and designs upside
down. In the resulting stampede, some highly practical ideas have been
lost, both in terms of design and process. This has substantially
watered down OO's ability to deliver on its promises of reuse and
maintainability. It has stranded a whole generation of applications with
distorted architectures, inside-out designs, and less maintainable code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aspects of these historical approaches do survive, such as the
prominence Agile gives to use-cases as a way to concretely tie together
requirements, design, testing, and acceptance. But some equally powerful
ideas, such as appropriate ways to manage dependencies within an
application, have seen relatively little use, and are only now being
rediscovered in guises such as the clean and hexagonal architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivar's book can certainly lay claim to being one of the earliest
published sources to lay out these ideas, and he does so with a style
that is convincingly thoughtful. This is the work of an intelligent man,
honed and refined over many years of practice. The omission of modern
testing techniques are the only thing that substantially dates the
content. Otherwise I found it exciting, insightful and revolutionary. It
seems naive to claim that this book describes the One True Architecture
which is applicable to all systems. But it certainly seems very widely
applicable, and has deeply affected my thinking on all projects larger
than a couple of weeks' work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book also discusses software development methodology in an
intriguingly meta way, constructing an object-oriented model of the
process itself. Each software development team or organisation
represents a particular implementation of this model. Parallels with the
execution of software are drawn, with the output of one part of the
process, e.g. design work, having to produce results that conform to the
expectations of the downstream process, such as implementation. In this
way, sections of the process can be removed and replaced by compatible
alternatives, to better suit the application domain and the organisation
within which the project is embedded. These ideas seem less immediately
applicable and actionable. Maybe that's just my personal circumstance.
Perhaps they are more applicable to larger projects, which I avoid these
days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/10 if you're going to enjoy 500 pages of software design principles
and case studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0/10 if you're not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>books</category><category>media</category><category>non-fiction</category><category>software</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/object-oriented-software-engineering-a-use-case-driven-approach/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2014 20:26:43 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
