&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2019/06/miracleman.jpg" style="float: left; padding: 1em"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miracleman, books 1, 2 &amp;amp; 3&lt;/em&gt; by Alan Moore, Alan Davies, &amp;amp; John Totleben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a little time digging out earlier works of Alan Moore. These
inter-library loans didn't disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally published as &lt;em&gt;Marvelman&lt;/em&gt; by Mick Anglo, from
1954-59. Legal battles rebranded the character as &lt;em&gt;Miracleman&lt;/em&gt; in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening pages reprint one of those campy early stories, involving
primary-colored moralizing while flying around to punch time-travelling Nazi
super-scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then continue with Alan Moore's postmodern 1980s reboot. This recasts the
simplistic tales of the original period as a placating dream, fed to a captured
Miracleman by his nemesis. His hokey origins story is similarly re-ploughed. The
ensuing tales are dark and introspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thread follows the emotional stresses placed on Miracleman when incarnated
as his human alter-ego, the frail and fallible half of a godlike being. He's
unable to conceive a child with his wife, although &lt;em&gt;Miracleman&lt;/em&gt; can, and
succumbs to self-loathing and jealousy, culminating in a touching scene in
which he climbs a mountain, leaves a forlorn monument, and changes into
Miracleman one last time, never to change back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is more uneven than Moore's later works. Yes, it's unashamedly an
underwear-on-the-outside superhero story. But nonetheless I loved it, and
scenes like the above have stayed with me for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="clear: both"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2019/06/swamp-thing-vol-1.jpg" style="float: left; padding: 1em"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Swamp Thing, Vol 1: Saga of the Swamp Thing&lt;/em&gt; by Alan Moore, John Totleben, &amp;amp; Steve Bissette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moore's deconstruction of existing characters continues. Originally Swamp
Thing was Alec Holland, miraculously transformed by in infusion of
artificially stimulated plant matter. When Alan Moore takes over the writing,
Swamp Thing's ostracization and existential dread is compounded by the
discovery that this origins story has been a delusion all along. Alec Holland
was killed outright in the accident, and an accumulation of plant matter grew
around his decaying form, integrating the physical remains of his memories
into a creature that yearned to recapture its human form, but was never human
in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="clear: both"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2019/06/hull-zero-three.jpg" style="float: left; padding: 1em"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hull Zero Three&lt;/em&gt; by Greg Bear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A smashing hard SF tale, about the existential mystery of life aboard a
generation starship that has lost its way. Following in the footsteps of
classic variations, such as &lt;em&gt;Non-Stop&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Methusalah's Children&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tau
Zero&lt;/em&gt;, it centers around the character's revelations as they uncover their
situation and origins, being decanted to order by warring factions amongst
high technology ruins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="clear: both"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2019/06/station-eleven.jpg" style="float: left; padding: 1em"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Station Eleven&lt;/em&gt; by Emily St. John Mendel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An evocative tale of intertwined lives, before and after the sudden fall of
contemporary civilisation due to a global pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="clear: both"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atrocity Archive&lt;/em&gt; by Charles Stross. The conceit of Lovecraftian horror
rationalized to a mathematical or computable topic is appealing to me, and
kept the pages turning, but I didn't ultimately find it life-changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nightwings&lt;/em&gt; by Robert Silverberg. A fantastical far-future tale of humanity
split into occupational castes, guarding the world against prophesied
invasion. Not my thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>books</category><category>comics</category><category>fiction</category><category>media</category><category>novel</category><category>science-fiction</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/june-books/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2019 15:17:46 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>From Hell</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/from-hell/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="From Hell" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/07/fromhellsm.jpg"&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Alan Moore (author)&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;and Eddie Campbell (artist)&lt;/em&gt;,
1989.
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hell-Alan-Moore/dp/0861661419" title="From Hell"&gt;On amazon.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moore has almost single-handedly transformed the definition of the comic
industry in the last 20 years, and this fetishistically researched
comic-book dramatisation of the dark and macabre Jack the Ripper murders
is no exception to his visionary high standards. Moore plunges headlong
into the sensational conspiracy theory that Royal Physician, Dr. William
Gull, killed East End prostitutes to silence the story of an
illegitimate royal baby, under the direct orders of the implacable Queen
Victoria herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Gull regards his mission as the great work of his life, which will
not only quash the threat to the crown, but also fulfil ancient pagan
destinies, reasserting the male dominance over matriarchy that began
when the Romans reclaimed London and slew Queen Boadicea. Gull knows
this because he has knelt before his God, who told him just what needed
to be done. As a doctor, Gull knows that these visions are madness,
brought about by his stroke of the previous year. As a man, however, he
responds that "If this is madness, who'd be sane?", and, embracing the
subjective reality of his hallucinations, he goes about his work with
gusto, confiding along the way in his witless coachman and reluctant
accomplice, Nettley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Dr Gull and coachman Nettley" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/07/boadicea-died-sm.jpg" title="Dr. Gull &amp;amp; coachman Nettley"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is a tapestry, woven on many levels. The iniquities of wealth
and power are richly depicted as the poverty-stricken residents of the
East End are contrasted with the powers-that-be, who move swiftly and
decisively to ensure that Gull is never caught nor found out, for fear
of scandal, even while he goes on killing with impunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appalling violence of the murders and dismemberment of the victims
is shown in unflinching detail, one pivotal 34-page chapter "The Best of
all Tailors", consisting solely of the actions of Gull, a renowned
surgeon, with his victim in a tiny, squalid room, which made me
profoundly grateful that the sketches are only in black-and-white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such graphic nastiness is not for no reason. Gull is convinced that the
act of violence is a pivotal part of the ancient and grisly prophesies
he is enacting. Under the psychological strain of each successive
murder, Gull experiences increasingly vivid hallucinations, symptoms of
his condition. But then, something altogether strange starts to happen.
As his visions become more vivid, Gull begins to experience glimpses of
the future. Visions of our time. At times and places where people have
historically claimed to have seen the ghost of Jack the Ripper, Moore
cunningly reverses the perspective, allowing Gull to see them also. By
the end, Gull's visions have him stalking the sterile hallways of the
modern world in blood-soaked shirtsleeves, roaring at oblivious office
workers, exhorting them to look up and remember the history from which
our century was birthed in blood. The ancient magic that Gull raved
about was real, while we have lost our connection to our violent and
animal past, and with it, our very humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rating: 10/10.
Cor blimey it's a classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>books</category><category>comics</category><category>fiction</category><category>media</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/from-hell/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jul 2007 03:34:22 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
