&lt;img alt="Spoilers" src="https://tartley.com/files/spoilers.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major spoilers ahead. It's seven years old at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt="Soma - protagonist" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/soma-protagonist.webp"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soma is a creepy survival horror game, that leans deeply into the moral and
existential quandaries arising from the deterministic principle that it's
possible to scan one's brain and copy the structure into some other substrate,
yielding a second conscious entity, which thinks it is you. So there are deep
science-fiction issues in play here, about whether we think such a scheme could
ever possibly work, and about the practical, personal, and societal
ramifications of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved the setup. A humdrum morning begins in your present-day Toronto
apartment. A note on the fridge reminds you that today is the day of your
medical appointment, a brain scan. Reaching the doctor's office by train, you
find the experimental new type of brain scanner, run by some PhD in a
cable-strewn side-office. Sit in the chair, don the helmet, wait for the scan
to complete and- blink! Suddenly, you are elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the game progresses, it becomes obvious that the version of you that sat
down in the seat did not experience this discontinuity. They completed the
scan, removed the helmet, and continued their normal, everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are not that copy. You open your eyes to a grim, decrepit cyberpunk future.
Exploring, your only company is a menagerie of half-functional robots and
drones, many of which are insane, and, in conversation, seem to be under the
impression that they are human beings. It gradually becomes apparent that
perceptual filters are in play, preventing them - and you - from noticing they
are no longer human. At one point the ocean crashes in on you, and you drown
for a little while, or at least think you are, but you still don't die. At that
point you have to acknowledge the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have awoken to the year 2104, and the recorded brain scans of real humans
are being used to animate drones. This is a scenario much like that told from a
different perspective in the smashing short story
&lt;a href="https://qntm.org/mmacevedo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by qntm.
Failing systems engaged fall-backs, resulting in your obsolete brain scan being
yanked from storage to inhabit an advanced humanoid robot, in a facility deep
under the ocean, some time after a comet strike has scoured all life from the
planet's surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that wasn't bad enough, one facilitating technology of this nightmarish
scenario, a black goo that mimics and improves upon electrical and biological
circuitry it comes into contact with, has run rampant, growing probing tendrils
which are wrecking the facility. Among other effects, it has reanimated the
corpses of the last few humans, who skulk around, not in a good way. As our
protagonist asks, incredulously, "You mean they've been brought back to life?".
Our reassuring AI companion replies "Yeah, let's call it that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game borrows the highly effective mechanics of Frictional's previous games,
the Amnesia and Penumbra series, where the proximity of horrific, shambling
enemies causes your character to experience debilitating symptoms, including,
in this case, static-y visual distortions as your neural hardware suffers from
some overload or interference. This applies even if you simply look at an
enemy, an act which immediately draws their attention. So your only chance to
survive encounters is to stay well out of sight, and actively avert your eyes
so you can't even watch what's going on. Not being able to see exactly what
your enemies are, or what they are up to, turns out to be fabulously scary and
atmospheric. At one point it lead directly to my wife catching me staring
intently at a blank, black screen for a prolonged period, with a peculiar
expression on my face, as I hid in a dark cupboard waiting for the slithering
sounds behind me to go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spurring us through this environment are not just threats to our immediate
survival, but also the adoption of a project, to launch into space a
solar-powered simulation, hosting all the last remaining brain scans of the
now-defunct human race, known as the 'ARK'. This will allow the on-board sims
to live a prolonged period of idyllic virtual existence, preserving at least
some echo of what humanity was. Since the conceit of the game is that our
character is a living and conscious entity that feels real emotion, the sims on
the ARK are all presumably the same, so this seems like a worthwhile endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are guided, motivated, and assisted by "Catherine", a simulated personality
running on our hand-held omni-tool, based on the brain recording of an AI
researcher, whose project during her lifetime was the ARK. Plugging her in to a
wall or console socket lets her interface with our surroundings, activating
power supplies and manipulating machinery. She leads us through a series of
undersea facilities, linked by trains, submersibles, and the occasional
disorienting trudge across the murky ocean floor, stirred up by ferocious
currents and landslides, populated by organic-mechanical hybrid horrors that
glide by in the darkness. I found these some of the absolute best, most
atmospheric "walking simulator" moments I've experienced in a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt="The ocean floor, stirred up by currents and landslides" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/soma-murky.webp"&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Is that another distant light up ahead? Good luck finding them while the currents pummel you,
and hideous, deadly beasts loom out of the murk.
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, we encounter a few unforgettable scenarios. We come across the
failing storage system in which the last remaining copy of our own brain scan
resides. I decide to flip some buttons which delete it, prompting my character
to respond with something like "Let this be the last time I wake up in this
godforsaken place."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At another point, we find ourselves trapped within a collapsing facility on the
bottom of the ocean, with the gibbering undead hammering on the door from the
next room. There is an airlock leading out into the ocean, but we would be
crushed at this depth. There is no way out. Luckily, Catherine is able to guide
us into assembling a more robust robot, one capable of withstanding the
pressure - all we have to do is sit in the chair and activate the transfer into
it. We already did this once, back in Toronto. Easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, after the transfer, we glance back across the lab at our original - the
pictured chap with red LED eyes - who, we notice, is still breathing. Asking
Catherine about it, she reminds us that the brain scan is not a destructive
operation. He's still in there, chemically subdued for the moment, but he'll
soon wake up again, wondering why the transfer didn't work. So we are left with
the option of stomping out of the airlock to safety, leaving him behind to his
nightmarish fate. Or flipping a switch to deactivate him before we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of these narrative beats work better as a game than they perhaps might in
a written story. They emphasize the player's complicity, your moral
culpability, which is a mode that games, for all their faults, can do better
than any other media. Plenty of the lesser moments along the way expose the
player to decisions about unplugging some human simulation or other which
declares itself to be "alive", but which is gating your progress in some way.
Some of them are yourself. Some of these acts require manhandling weighty
cables, which require large, insistent tugging with the mouse controls. It's
not just a disembodied button press. One has to provide a determined,
definitive, mechanical input to end a life. In context, the guilt feels real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the journey, we finally stumble across an honest-to-goodness real,
live human being. She describes how the rest of the humans will be gathered in
particular locations, while she stayed to protect the ARK. But, we tell her, we
just passed through those locations, and there were no humans remaining there.
We both know that the planet's surface is sterile. A beat passes before she
announces "So I'm the last human being left alive." She's deathly sick, and
without hope. By the end of your interactions she asks you to turn off her
life-support before you leave, and stay with her for her last wheezing moments.
So this is how humanity ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrying on, because what else is there to do? We finally we get the ARK loaded
into the launch system that delivers it to orbit, upload our brain scans onto
it just before it launches, and - we've done it! Success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a moment, about five minutes before the end, when I realized what was
going to happen here, even though my character had not. It was a real emotional
blow. I envied and pitied him for his naive hope. For believing there was still
a way out. For, of course, the ARK's launch changed nothing for us. Our
simulations are aboard it, but we are still sitting here, in a broken robot
corpse in a collapsing facility at the bottom of a haunted ocean on a dead
planet. The dispatched copy will enjoy life on the ARK, but we - like the copy
of ourselves we left behind earlier - are stuck here for good.

&lt;img alt="A laptop" src="https://tartley.com/files/2008/02/lappy.webp"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My employer, Canonical, has a "bring your own hardware" policy, trusting that
their engineers would rather choose and administer their own personal laptops,
rather than put up with standardized remotely administered corporate hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current much loved Thinkpad 460p has served faithfully since 2015, but is
showing its age, sometimes struggling under the workload. Plus, its integrated
graphics chipset doesn't have the power to play modern games with my kiddo.
Battlezone 98 runs fine, but Civilization VI (2016) is annoyingly choppy,
at about 9 frames per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt="Civilization VI screenshot" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/civ-vi.webp"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This summer I received the three-year cash-in-hand bonus earmarked as a
"hardware refresh bonus". It's been many years since I've bought a laptop with
the attention to detail that comes with spending one's own money. Even the
current aging Thinkpad was a gift from a former employer. So it's been a decade
or more since I've seriously specced out a new laptop. This post exists as a
place to scribble down reminders of a few things I learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a few constraints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About the same size as the current Thinkpad's 14 inches, or maybe a tiny bit
  bigger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I work on Ubuntu Linux, so I'll need to check it plays nicely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should support modern gaming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plenty of monitor ports, and/or the grunt to daisy chain them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it too much to ask for a headphone jack in 2022?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability for me to open it up, swap out the battery, drives, RAM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3:2 display would be nice, but these are rare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A budget of $2,000 (saving a bit of my bonus for other hardware-related things.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading around, I got sort-of up to speed on components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CPU&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CPU buzz is around Intel's 12th generation (aka "Alder Lake"). These are
"hybrid" CPUs, combining large high performance cores with smaller high
efficiency cores on a single chip. They come in about 30 different variants,
with a naming convention that looks like, for example: &lt;code&gt;Intel Core i7-12700H&lt;/code&gt;.
This consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A brand, eg. "Intel Core"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A modifier specifying a market segment, one of:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i3 Casual use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i5 Multitasking, light gaming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i7 Gaming, content creators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i9 Slightly faster, more parallel cores.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A single or double digit generation, eg the latest is "12".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An SKU, eg the "700" above, a three or four digit number which roughly
  corresponds to the feature-set or performance - larger is better. These are
  only comparable within a single generation, they adopt wildly different
  conventions in different generations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A single or double letter suffix, eg "H" for "high performance", taken from
  &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000058567/processors/intel-core-processors.html"&gt;an idiotic irregular table&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major alternative to an Intel processor is AMD. These aren't the current
season's darlings of the performance benchmarks, although they do include
several respectable contenders that might be great for my needs, as you can see
in the following performance comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Benchmarks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These laptop CPU performance benchmarks are culled from
&lt;a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/laptop.html"&gt;www.cpubenchmark.net&lt;/a&gt;,
sorted by the benchmark score. I included the top 20, plus a handful of notable
others that I looked up along the way. The 'bench' column measures relative
performance under a variety of benchmark workloads which fully utilize all
cores. The higher this number, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of cores is given as (p)erformance + (e)fficiency, for hybrid processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;

&lt;th style="text-align: left;"&gt;Cores&lt;/th&gt;

is 10x slower than the CPU I ended up getting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Graphics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of otherwise fantastic laptops which don't include blazing
fast dedicated Nvidia or AMD graphics processors, but instead only come with
relatively humdrum graphics support integrated with the CPU. Although
integrated GPUs have improved massively in the last few years, this wouldn't be
fast enough to run modern games well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compensate, I considered pairing such laptops with an external GPU enclosure
(eGPU), into which a top-of-the-line desktop GPU card can be plugged. I'm still
wistfully curious about this path, but in the end opted to do without this
complication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a table of the top laptop GPUs, culled from
&lt;a href="https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/"&gt;gpu.userbenchmark.com&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the CPU table,
this isn't the top N performers, because GPUs can get crazy fast and expensive,
so I'm looking for something middle-of-the-pack. It's just a selection of GPUs
I looked up while researching particular laptop models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 'performance' column is the combined result of a variety of gaming
benchmarks, the higher the better. The 'position' column compares the
performance against all other benchmarked GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the two 'integrated' entries at the bottom of the table, one of which is
my current laptop, a full 20x slower than the GPU I ended up getting. The
improvement ought to speed Civilization VI up to around an entirely excessive
180 frames per second. \o/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Laptop models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the above in mind, I read some reviews, and a few contenders emerged:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Framework&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Framework was massively tempting. It brings an entirely unprecedented
- some might hopefully say &lt;em&gt;revolutionary&lt;/em&gt; - focus on user-repair and
upgradability. Rather than soldering and gluing the whole thing together,
all the Framework's components, up to and including the motherboard and
screen, are replaceable using a single screwdriver. This is deeply appealing
for geeks, who want to be able to repair or upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside that gave me pause is it is only available with integrated
Intel-powered graphics. If they had a model including the vastly superior
Nvidia or AMD accelerated graphics, I would have just bought one months ago,
instead of prevaricating. But that complication, coupled with the fact that the
Framework's performance is only mid-range for a 2022 model, put me off
sufficiently to look around at other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dell XPS 13 plus&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dell XPS 13 plus looks wonderful, with official Ubuntu verification, no
less, but just isn't physically big enough for me, and is noticeably
underpowered. And the Dell 15 inch models seem way overpriced, for the spec,
easily exceeding my $2,000 budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;HP Dev One&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HP Dev One looks like a fabulous machine, a colleague just got one and is
very happy with it. But again, it only has integrated graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Mac Book Pro&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I considered this, repaved to run Ubuntu, of course, but to be honest, as
exquisite as the hardware was at one point, it seems somewhat stagnant and
directionless now, fifteen years later. Not unimpressive, but doesn't really
grab me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;System76&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at a whole bunch of other laptops at this point, scouring the "best
gaming laptops of 2022" lists at Toms Hardware and elsewhere. Eventually my
attention was drawn to System76, who, on reflection, should have been folks I
checked out earlier in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oryx is just a few hundred over my budget, even with the current $300 off.
But a tricked-out Gazelle seems to check all the boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt='Gazelle 15" laptop' src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/gazelle-15.avif"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have a reasonably high-ranked 12th generation Intel i7 CPU, which seems
to achieve good performance without wading into the diminishing returns
of pricey i9 models. Same for the reasonably-placed Nvidia 3060 graphics. And
the screen is just magic (judged by my admittedly idiosyncratic personal
criteria.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They support the lightning fast open source &lt;a href="https://www.coreboot.org"&gt;coreboot
firmware&lt;/a&gt;, and System76 are a leading contributor to
the project. They sell with Linux-pre-installed, and produce their own
Ubuntu-based Linux distribution, Pop!_OS (Although stock Ubuntu runs just fine
too.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going with Nvidia graphics instead of AMD does yield a performance boost, but
the downside is that I'll have to wrestle with the opaque proprietary drivers
from the famously uncooperative Nvidia. But in a nice gesture, System76
&lt;a href="https://support.system76.com/articles/graphics-switch-ubuntu"&gt;documents this
process&lt;/a&gt;, and
lots of other stuff, such as how to replace internal components yourself, on
their website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it's proprietary closed source, Nvidia drivers have always lagged
behind AMD's open source offerings in terms of compatibility. In particular,
Nvidia graphics hasn't worked with the new Linux Wayland display server.
Reading around, my impression is that it's not ready yet, but &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be by
22.10 (which is next month!?), so I could stick with the older XOrg display
server for now, without fearing that I'll get marooned there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other downsides. The keyboard is reputedly mediocre, and I wish it
didn't have a numpad. Standard layout tenkeyless for the win, every time. But I
almost always use a USB mechanical keyboard anyhow. Also, with such greedy
components, the battery life kinda sucks when the GPU is on and the machine is
busy. But in the last 12 months, the only time I've run my current laptop not
plugged in is... never? So I guess I don't care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="https://system76.com/laptops/gazelle#specs"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is what I ordered, with
the 15" display and the 3060 graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I did that thing where I order it with minimal RAM and SSD storage, to
replace with my own parts. So I'll have some screwdriver work to do after it
arrives. The payoff is that I save about $150 by paying market rates for these
components. In fact I already have a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-SN850-Internal-Gaming-Solid/dp/B0B7CPSN2K"&gt;tremendous
SSD&lt;/a&gt;
I can use, leftover from this year's Chia cryptocurrency farming experiments,
so that part is free. This means I can stay within my $2,000 budget, with $9 to
spare after shipping and taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Memory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's generally fine to just buy whatever RAM is recommended by your vendor.
But the most reliable and cheapest memory will often be the slowest, or at least
the one running at a clock speed which is most widely supported by different
motherboards. In order to get the &lt;em&gt;fastest&lt;/em&gt; memory for our particular laptop, we
need to understand a few things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Physical form factor&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current standard for RAM is DDR4. For laptops, the slim physical form
factor is known as SoDIMM. A single circuit board of memory chips is a
&lt;em&gt;module&lt;/em&gt;. A module connects into a motherboard &lt;em&gt;slot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DDR5 is supported by Intel's 12th generation processors, and AMD's newest Ryzen
7000 series. This uses a different physical connection on the motherboard, and
is rare thus far, outside of systems above my budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm looking for DDR4 in a SoDIMM module. Got it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ranks &amp;amp; Channels&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A module contains from one to eight 64-bit wide logical &lt;em&gt;blocks&lt;/em&gt; of data storage
(single, dual, quad or octal &lt;em&gt;rank&lt;/em&gt;.) The chips on a module provide x1, x2, x4
or x8 &lt;em&gt;banks&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;number of chips x chip banks / 64 = module rank
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;eg. Using sixteen x4 chips will provide a single rank of memory on the module
(16x4/64=1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas using 32 x8 chips will provide a module of 4 ranks (32x8/64=4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is sometimes annotated on the module using a notation like 1Rx4, as in one
rank of x4 chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason this matters is that access to ranks is interleaved, so multiple
ranks can provide access to data at multiples of the rate provided by a single
rank. In order to take advantage of this, the motherboard must provide a
commensurate number of memory access &lt;em&gt;channels&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The
&lt;a href="https://tech-docs.system76.com/models/gaze17/README.html"&gt;datasheet for my Gazelle&lt;/a&gt;
says the motherboard has two memory slots, and supports dual-channel access.
This could be fully utilized by either inserting a single dual-rank module
(which is more expensive), or, as in the timeworn heuristic, by inserting two
half-sized single rank modules (e.g. two 16GB modules to make 32GB total.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Clock frequencies and latency&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAM has a clock frequency, measured in thousands of MHz, but "double data rate"
chips transfer data on both the clock's rising and falling edges, so the speed
of transfer is better measured in mega-transfers per second (MT/s), the higher
the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it takes more than one clock cycle to perform an action. These latency
values are sometimes quoted as a series of four integers - the number of clock
cycles to perform particular operations, e.g. 18-18-18-43. But these are often
abbreviated to just the first number, representing read access time, known as
"CAS Latency" (CL), eg. CL 18, which tends to be representative. The lower this
number is, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual performance of the memory is determined by the product of a clock
cycle duration (eg. 1ns at 1000MHz) and the latency number (e.g. 1ns * 18 =
18ns)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the motherboard needs to support the RAM's clock speed. In practice,
the motherboard will negotiate with the inserted modules to find a commonly
supported frequency, the same or less than the minimum of the rated memory
access frequencies of the module, the motherboard, and the CPU, using an
over-complicated and hard-to-predict process controlled by BIOS settings. I
have no experience with this but it sounds well worth avoiding altogether by
making sure we get modules with a rated frequency that exactly matches the
advertised clock frequency of our motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my new Gazelle,
&lt;a href="https://tech-docs.system76.com/models/gaze17/README.html"&gt;the manual&lt;/a&gt;
says that is 3,200MHz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Availability, pricing and scams.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding CL26 latency RAM at 3,200MHz is easy, for around $70. For lower
latencies the price goes up to about $375 for CL16, but that isn't even in
stock anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, after much searching, I found some CL16 on newegg.com:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Memory on sale in Newegg - scam" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/memory-on-sale.webp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is only $128! Carefully checking the specs, including those on the
manufacturer's site, using the shown model number 'CMSX32GX4M2A3000C16',
this is exactly what we want. 2x16GB at 3200MT/s at CL16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While checking it out, I clicked around a bit, and at one point found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bad review on Newegg" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/bad-review-on-newegg.webp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This came along with a number of other negative reviews, stating customers had
been sent memory modules that were fake, ie. imitations of the purported
reputable manufacturer, they didn't work at the advertised clock speeds, and
the seller had gone dark on them, taking weeks to respond to queries, and not
sending replacements until Newegg got involved. Seems wisest to skip this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I found an alternative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Memory on sale in Newegg - legit" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/memory-on-sale-legit.webp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! DDR4 in a SoDIMM package, 2x16GB modules at 3,200MHz and 18CL. The latency
isn't quite as good, but it sounds legit, so I'll take it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that, I'm done. Now just awaiting the deliveries to arrive...&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>hardware</category><category>journal</category><category>linux</category><guid>https://tartley.com/posts/new-laptop-time/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2022 16:59:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>TIL: Creating Animated Meme GIFs on the Command-Line</title><link>https://tartley.com/posts/creating-animated-meme-gifs-on-the-command-line/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Got sick of navigating the limitations of various online services to create
animated gif memes, finally figured out how to do it manually. Not a universal
process, just what worked for my situation. (Which is Ubuntu 21.10, "Impish".)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of of the ffmpeg invocations could probably be combined into one, but I
show the commands as I used them, as I was figuring each step out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Download a video&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting from a video on YouTube:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6-gJMs6DwuE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To download this locally,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl"&gt;install &lt;code&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
hit the YouTube &lt;em&gt;share&lt;/em&gt; button to grab the video's encoded URL,
and:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;youtube-dl https://youtu.be/6-gJMs6DwuE -o Ash.mp4
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gives me an 850KB .mp4 video file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Split&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only want the final few seconds. To remove the start of the video,
keeping from 6.5 seconds until the end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;ffmpeg -hide_banner -i Ash.mp4 -acodec copy -vcodec libx264 -ss 00:00:06.5 Ash-split.mp4
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Args to ffmpeg are position sensitive. Specifying '-ss' (to split the file)
before the input ('-i') can't create the split at an accurate location, since
it has to guess whereabouts in the file the given timestamp will occur. But
putting it after the input (as done here) means it can split accurately on the
given timestamp, since the file has been processed by the time this arg gets
actioned, so accurate timestamp/frame conversion is known, at the cost of
having had to process even the parts of the video that are then discarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vcodec of libx264 is specified because, according to stackoverflow,
"&lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5651654/ffmpeg-how-to-split-video-efficiently#comment85070704_13289426"&gt;scenes in mp4 are broken&lt;/a&gt;", whatever that means,
and specifying "copy", as most people do, gives me an output with no video,
only audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This results in a three second, 217KB .mp4 video file. (the following is just an
image of it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ash-split.webp" src="https://tartley.com/files/2021/ash-split.webp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Crop&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To crop out the black bars from the top and bottom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;ffmpeg -hide_banner -i Ash-split.mp4 -vf 'crop=iw:365' Ash-split-crop.mp4
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we crop it to the input width "iw", and 365 high. In the absense of
any offset ordinates for the crop, ffmpeg defaults to centering them, so this
365 pixels are taken from the (spatial, vertical) middle of the video, which is
exactly what we want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This results in a three second, 220KB .mp4 video file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ash-split-crop.webp" src="https://tartley.com/files/2021/ash-split-crop.webp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Resize and convert to gif&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;hide_banner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;Ash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;crop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;mp4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;vf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;'scale=512:-1'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;Ash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;crop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;resize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s s-Atom"&gt;gif&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This results in a grainy-but-passable three second 750KB animated .gif:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ash-split-crop-resize.gif" src="https://tartley.com/files/2021/ash-split-crop-resize.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file size can be smaller, if you care, most easily by splitting a shorter
video clip, reducing the frame rate, or reducing the 'scale' in this step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternately, this could be done using ImageMagik's 'convert', but the result
of that was a very large (10MB) file and played very slowly, and I wasn't
immediately sure how to fix that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Add text&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Imagemagik's 'convert':&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;convert \
    Ash-split-crop-resize.gif \
    -coalesce \
    -font impact -pointsize 36 -fill white -stroke black -strokewidth 2 \
    -gravity north -annotate +0+0 'I can''t lie about your chances, but' \
    -gravity south -annotate +0+0 'you have my sympathies' \
    -layers Optimize \
    Ash-split-crop-resize-text.gif
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The '-coalesce' option removes all the .gif optimizations, then we apply the
text labels, then the '-layers' option re-applies optimizations. Without this
dance, the text is all twitchy and messy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voilà. Imagine sending it to a co-worker who is taking on a difficult task,
like making changes to that thorny section of the codebase that nobody likes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ash-split-crop-resize-text.gif" src="https://tartley.com/files/2021/ash-split-crop-resize-text.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>geek</category><category>image</category><category>linux</category><category>terminal</category><category>til</category><category>video</category><category>youtube</category><guid>https://tartley.com/posts/creating-animated-meme-gifs-on-the-command-line/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 21:32:10 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>TIL: Download audio from YouTube</title><link>https://tartley.com/posts/download-audio-from-youtube/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;For the sort of weirdos who still host their own music files, but aren't
preciously audiophile about it. Aaaaand also I'm wording this with the
assumption you're a Linux, command-line and Python nerd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it's a video which is explicitly Creative Commons. Other times, it's
a friend's otherwise unpublished non-commercial thing. Or maybe it's a massive
commercial product from a famously litigious corporate behemoth, but you've
already bought the soundtrack and you just really &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wish you had a
version which had the exact same sound effects or dialog or arrangement that
you or your child has grown to love from obsessive movie re-watches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've got ya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;One-off setup:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;a href="https://ffmpeg.org/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a venerable open-source command-line
video/audio conversion tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;sudo&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;apt&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ffmpeg
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, install &lt;a href="https://pypa.github.io/pipx/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;pipx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a tool to install
commmand-line tools that are distributed as Python packages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;python3&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-m&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pip&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--user&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pipx
python3&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-m&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pipx&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ensurepath
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, use pipx to install the &lt;a href="https://youtube-dl.org/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an
oft-sued but never vanquished tool to download YouTube videos. (We're using
the Python package because the apt package is too old to work):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;pipx&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;youtube-dl
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Goal fulfillment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, download your precious audio:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;youtube-dl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-x&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--audio-format&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;best&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;URL
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;URL&lt;/code&gt; is the encoded version of the video URL (i.e. like "youtu.be/XXX"),
  obtained by hitting the 'share' button on the YouTube page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-x&lt;/code&gt; requests just the audio part, with no video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While &lt;code&gt;--audio-format=best&lt;/code&gt; is ostensibly the default setting, meaning
  YouTube decides which format to send, using &lt;code&gt;-x&lt;/code&gt; seems to fail if we don't
  specify this explicitly. Alternatively, you can explicitly request "aac",
  "flac", "mp3", "m4a", "opus", "vorbis", or "wav". As I understand it, YouTube
  will only send the requested format if the uploader provided it. If they
  didn't then we get whatever YouTube provides and then convert it locally
  using ffmpeg. So you sometimes won't be getting the benefit of those lossless
  formats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But mp3 works well enough for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSJWvzLuGz8"&gt;my&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENVIoR2f-Qgh"&gt;needs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, for playlists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;youtube-dl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-x&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--audio-format&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;best&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--yes-playlist&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-i&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;URL
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--yes-playlist&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;--no-playlist&lt;/code&gt; chooses which to download if the URL you
  provide is both a playlist and a video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-i&lt;/code&gt; ignores errors, so one bad track in the playlist doesn't stop the whole
  thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My previous inferior way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method is worse because it downloads the whole video file before
extracting audio locally, and the download gets throttled by YouTube in
some way, which of late is very slow indeed, i.e. substantially slower
than watching the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the video from YouTube:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;youtube-dl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;URL
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This results in a webm file. I have no idea what that is, and am relieved
to discover that converting it into an mp3 requires just:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;ffmpeg&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-i&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;MyVideoFile&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-vn&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;MyAudioFile.mp3
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code&gt;-vn&lt;/code&gt; disables video in the output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Changelog&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2023/02/14: Wide-ranging rewrite of prose to enliven, enlink, and clarify.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2023/02/14: Swapped use of &lt;a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;pipsi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  tool, last released 2015, for &lt;em&gt;pipx&lt;/em&gt;, which is more useful, well-maintained
  and popular.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2022: Added "Goal fulfillment" section, initially called "The Best Way", and
  deprecated the previous method under "My previous inferior way".&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be interested in seeing some example lxd config files,
bash command history when creating, etc?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here goes then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have one LXD container running for each nontrivial development project I'm
working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;lxc&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ls

&lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;siab&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;RUNNING&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;.44.99.128&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;eth0&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;CONTAINER&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;tartley-com&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;RUNNING&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;.44.99.161&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;eth0&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;CONTAINER&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the gate we see one source of confusion. "LXD", the daemon, is a
newer project that builds on top of "LXC" the containers. However the user
interface to all the new LXD-goodness is through a command-line called "lxc",
which replaces the older command line tool called "lxd". :-/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a new one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;lxc&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;launch&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ubuntu:16.04&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-p&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;default&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-p&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;jhartley&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;demo
Creating&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;demo
Starting&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;demo
real&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;0m9.593s
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once created, they take about 3 seconds to stop and 0.5 seconds to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those "-p" options cause the container to use two &lt;em&gt;profiles&lt;/em&gt;. They are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;default&lt;/em&gt; profile, which I've never touched. It's just doing whatever it
   always does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;jhartley&lt;/em&gt; profile, I created in a one-off step by running a Bash script
   derived from instructions one of my colleagues passed around. I'll describe
   it at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a new container is up, we can execute commands directly on it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;lxc&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;demo&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;hostname
demo
$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;lxc&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;demo&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;whoami
root
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

jhartley@demo&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;$
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better than using IP addresses, you can run a DNS server to recognize
&lt;code&gt;{containername}.lxd&lt;/code&gt; hostnames. (This part is from
&lt;a href="https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/a-way-to-resolve-container-lxd-from-host-in-all-cases/3698"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find your lxd bridge IPv4 address&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;lxc&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;network&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;show&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;lxdbr0
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create file &lt;code&gt;/etc/systemd/network/lxd.network&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Match]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;lxdbr0&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Network]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;IPADDR/24&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;IPADDR&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Domains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;~lxd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where IPADDR is the lxdbr0 IPv4 address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;sudo&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;systemctl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;enable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;systemd-networkd
sudo&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;reboot&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;now
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;jhartley@t460&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ssh&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;demo.lxd
jhartley@demo&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# \o/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One nice thing is that DNS works both from the host and on the containers,
so your services can be configured by default to talk to each other at
SERVICE1.lxd, SERVICE2.lxd. Then running them in containers on your host
they would just find each other. We don't actually do this, but it seems
trivially easy to do. I should ask why we don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice I wrap up the ssh command with my accumulated foibles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;jhartley@demo&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-a&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;lssh
lssh&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;
lssh&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;TERM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;xterm-color&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ssh&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-A&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-t&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.lxd"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"cd &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$PWD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; exec &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$SHELL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; -l"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I forget why -A and -t were required. The rest is mostly just to start the
shell on the container in the same directory as I was in on the host. There
is probably a simpler way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The booooooring bits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we started the container, we mentioned
&lt;a href="https://tartley.com/files/2020/setup-lxd-profile.sh"&gt;a one-off setup script&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script does a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creates a new key pair specifically to SSH to the container.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creates the custom &lt;em&gt;jhartley&lt;/em&gt; profile, which causes all containers started
   with it to:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new user on the container with user and group ID mapped to
      those of my user on the host, presumably so that file permissions work
      for...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mount my $HOME directory on the container. Might not always be what you
      want, but works for me right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doubtless due to my own misunderstanding somewhere, in order to get working
   IPv4 connections to my containers, I had to disable IPv6 connections to
   them.&lt;/li&gt;

the page):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://tartley.com/files/2020/Dina-v2.93-otf.tar.gz"&gt;&lt;span class="emoji"&gt;📦&lt;/span&gt; Dina-v2.93-otf.tar.gz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pango/issues/386"&gt;Pango dropped support for naive bitmap fonts&lt;/a&gt;
in v1.44 -- i.e. from Ubuntu 20.04, &lt;em&gt;Focal&lt;/em&gt;, onwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So all bitmap fonts need to be converted into a format that will render,
ie. a vector format such as OpenType that allows bitmaps to be embedded.
(Not a conversion of the bitmap into an outline, losing the advantages of
the crisp, tiny bitmaps.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most bitmap fonts, this conversion will be done for you, by packagers
or font authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you'll need to do it yourself for any peripheral fonts that you love
more than your distribution does. Here's how I did it for my
&lt;a href="http://www.dcmembers.com/jibsen/download/61/"&gt;beloved Dina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Identify the font file.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;fc-list&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;grep&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Dina
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Convert.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use either command line tools, or fontforge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2.1 Using fontforge&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A GUI tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open up fontforge, paste the font path in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File / generate fonts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left dropdown: "OpenType (CFF)"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right dropdown: "In TTF/OTF"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results have some problems. I'm using it in gnome-terminal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People converting other fonts report issues with ugly gaps between
  characters. But I don't see that, perhaps because it's a monospace font?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The converted font is invisible in font selection dialogs, making it look
  like the process did not work. But once selected, by clicking around blindly,
  then the font displays fine in applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a font size which is not defined in the font displays a blank terminal,
  instead of falling back to some other font.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using ctrl-+/- to select font sizes cycles through three of the four
  defined sizes. I don't know why it skips one. But all four are usable if
  you explicitly select a size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2.2 Using command-line tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process is described at
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BitmapFontConversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu's released version of fonttosfnt (1.0.4) produces unusable results:
* Only the 1st and 2nd smallest font sizes are preserved.
* In the 2nd smallest size, all variations are too bold, so that 'bold'
  variations look 'double-bold'. (Italics looks really ugly too, this may
  just be a result of the enboldening.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TODO: Consider trying the latest fonttosfnt (1.1.0)
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/app/fonttosfnt
or at least filing an issue there to try and get some help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Install&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy to &lt;code&gt;~/.local/share/fonts&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;~/.fonts&lt;/code&gt;, right?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;fc-cache -f&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The result&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, it doesn't look like much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://tartley.com/files/2020/terminal-dina-small-ll.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But compare it with a regular vector font. Here's Ubuntu Mono, the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; of
the vector fonts I could find at these sizes. Blurry and inconsistent and hard
to read:&lt;/p&gt;

adding a CPU meter to my desktop involved crafting
&lt;a href="https://github.com/tartley/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/conky"&gt;my own conky configuration file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, building your own is a chore that crops up when you least expect
it. But on the other hand, the opportunity for functional and aesthetic
work results in something artisnally crafted to exactly meet your own personal
needs. Something you can feel a little pride about. An elegant weapon,
for a more... civilized age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="An elegant weapon, for a more... civilised age." src="https://tartley.com/files/2020/conky.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>linux</category><guid>https://tartley.com/posts/conky/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2020 22:09:13 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Installing Colout</title><link>https://tartley.com/posts/installing-colout/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nojhan.github.io/colout/"&gt;Colout&lt;/a&gt; is amazing, I use it all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Colout on PyPI now works just fine, all the following is needless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;code&gt;pip install colout&lt;/code&gt; from PyPI is broken, and has been for many months,
due to a typo in the
&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/colout/"&gt;latest (v0.5) PyPI release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've tried to contact the author, with email and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/nojhan/colout/issues/101i"&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; on the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/nojhan/colout/issues"&gt;Colout Github project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has had no effect, although I see the author has made substantial commits
to the Github project in that time, including fixing this problem and tagging a
new v0.6 version, although has not released any of that to PyPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in increasing order of desirability, you can either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clone the latest repo &lt;a href="https://github.com/nojhan/colout"&gt;from Github&lt;/a&gt;, and
install from that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# cd to the clone, then&lt;/span&gt;
python3&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-m&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pip&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--user&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, pip install the version I uploaded to PyPI, which is a straight copy of the
latest Github at the time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;pip&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--user&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;colout-fix
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, best of all, pip install straight from the original Github repo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;pip&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--user&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;git+git://github.com/nojhan/colout.git
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that, throughout, we're using &lt;code&gt;--user&lt;/code&gt;, so that you can install
development tools like this system-wide for the current user, without needing a
virtualenv, without needing root access, and without modifying your installed
Python system libraries.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>geek</category><category>linux</category><category>terminal</category><guid>https://tartley.com/posts/installing-colout/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 26 Jan 2019 00:40:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Running Multiple Firefox Profiles on Linux</title><link>https://tartley.com/posts/running-multiple-firefox-profiles/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently switched from Chrome to Firefox. It's so &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;, and easier
to trust that Mozilla has my privacy and interests at heart than Google
does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to run a second profile at work, to keep a distinct set of open
tabs, bookmarks, and the like. Here's how I did it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Close all Firefox windows. Run the Profile Manager with &lt;code&gt;firefox -p&lt;/code&gt;.
Create a second profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Firefox and find the directories your profiles live by browsing to
&lt;code&gt;about:profiles&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substitute those directories into this firefox.desktop file, where I've
marked 'XXX':&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# Gnome3 .desktop file for Firefox with multiple profiles&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Desktop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Firefox&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Comment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Browse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;web&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;GenericName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Web&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Browser&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Keywords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Internet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;WWW&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Browser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Web&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Explorer&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save the above as firefox.desktop and install using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;desktop-file-validate&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;firefox.desktop
$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;desktop-file-install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--dir&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;.local/share/applications&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;firefox.desktop
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This results in a Firefox icon in your applications menu that defaults
to whichever profile you mark as default in the ProfileManager, but
right clicking lets you select the home or work profile explicitly. Open
each, and change the theme in one of them so the windows are visually
distinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tested on Ubuntu, RHEL 7.3, probably works on all Gnome3 desktops.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>geek</category><category>linux</category><guid>https://tartley.com/posts/running-multiple-firefox-profiles/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2018 00:40:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Automate Gnome keybindings</title><link>https://tartley.com/posts/automate-gnome-keybindings/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Sick of manual GUI twiddling to fix inconsistent keybindings on various

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;works great on RHEL,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;doesn't all work on Ubuntu&amp;lt;=17.04, I suspect because Unity has
    it's own set of keybinds that are defined elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;works great on Ubuntu 17.10. especially if you go in manually to
    disable the built-in keybinding for Super-V, which displays the
    calendar and notifications window, which shadows my 'toggle window
    maximize vertically'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embedded in that is the ultimate solution to my longstanding irk with
Unity and Gnome's default window switcher (alt-tab.) By default it
groups windows of a single application together, requiring some extra
-grave pressing to navigate between windows within an application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This not only requires way more effort, but also breaks the expected
behaviour of just tapping alt-tab to go back to the last used window.
Instead it goes back to the last used application, so you can't toggle
between two windows of the same application, eg. two terminals. Absolute
madness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above modifies alt-tab to just cycle through all windows, ungrouped,
which fixes the ability to toggle between last two windows. Also,
alt-grave is provided as an alternative to cycle backwards through the
windows, which is easier to hit than shift-alt-tab.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>bash</category><category>linux</category><category>terminal</category><guid>https://tartley.com/posts/automate-gnome-keybindings/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2017 01:06:47 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
