&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by David Foster Wallace (1996)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had such a diverse set of reactions to this, and how could I not?
The writing is bold and idiosyncratic throughout. The novel's story is
not presented in chronological order, and the timeline is obfuscated by
the gleeful adoption of 'subsidised time', in which traditional numeric
monikers denoting each calender year are replaced by the sponsored
labels designated by major corporations - 'Year of the Whopper', and so
on - a marvellous concept which nevertheless makes it completely and
artificially impossible to tell what the hell's going on until about 500
pages in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole novel unashamedly celebrates the author's literary and formal
grammatical credentials - from the extraordinarily-crafted opening
scene, where a tragically misunderstood literary genius disastrously
fails a university entrance interview, with just a hint of a
semi-autobiographical air about him. Scenes of superlative execution are
interspersed with a narrative that is, on the whole, told in the third
person but in the argot of the currently eminent protagonist, leading to
large swathes of the book which are, like, more than conversational in
their familiarity. The combination gives rise to a relentlessly
inventive stream of neology and malapropism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the book resoundingly makes many insightful points by the conclusion, the
story which serves as a vehicle for their delivery is, a collision of ideas,
introducing entirely new and unexplored premises at the 11th hour, which
peter out, ignored and unresolved, by the final page. The jest continues
on, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insidious footnotes for which Wallace's writings are well-known do
not serve to streamline the prose by separating out incidental
annotations, but instead seem specifically employed to elevate the
reader's awareness of the footnotes themselves. Including them in the
main body of the text would allow for the possibility of a busy reader
failing to give each pithy addendum it's full, weighty consideration.
Wallace cunningly obviates this possibility, by discreetly giving pause
to any reader assiduously trying to do their best with a challenging
book, requiring them to invoke the titillating ritual of thumbing
forward a literal thousand pages or so, giving an involuntary moment of
rest in the narrative in which the reader may properly anticipate the
mysterious text to be revealed while they dereference the footnote's
numeric identifier, and then a second pause afterwards to properly
digest and appreciate, while they thumb a literal thousand pages back
again to find where they left off. Three hundred and eighty eight times,
no less. Plus sub-footnotes, obviously. Some of these are pages-long
tomes of critically insightful dialog between major characters. Many
others are completely irrelevant technical specifications. I have to
ask, what the fuck is going on here? Does this really make the novel
somehow better? While I laughed and cried about the content of many of
the footnotes, I remain unconvinced by the mechanism of their delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rant about these aspects of style because these are definitely the
first impressions any reader will have. Getting into the book &lt;a href="http://kottke.org/09/03/growing-sentences-with-david-foster-wallace"&gt;does
require a little
work&lt;/a&gt;.
But fortunately Wallace more than provides the incentive to do so. The
book ranges over many areas, but is mostly about addiction, in its many
forms, and its relationship to freedom of will and to happiness. These
are deep and interesting topics, and are unflinchingly explored with a
very keen eye. For every one of the annoyances mentioned above, the book
provides powerful rewards for those who stick it out. The
heart-wrenching depictions of people going through the utter destruction
of their humanity are as touching and insightful as anything I have
read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some problems or tasks in life which are small enough that an
individual can overcome them by force of will, grinding down the problem
until it is flattened and overcome. This approach fails, however, when
the problem is too large or too hard. Some problems cannot be crushed by
any individual. To navigate past them requires that, instead of trying
to demolish the problem, the individual must instead mould themselves to
fit around the problem's existing contours. People emerge on the other
side of these experiences triumphant but sober - having been changed to
their core by the experience. I consider &lt;em&gt;Infinite Jest&lt;/em&gt; to belong to
this latter class of experience. From the base-camp of its 981 pages
(plus 98 of footnotes), it is intimidating and uncompromising. You love
it and hate it in equal measure, and it makes no attempt to pander to
the former. But as I ploughed on, through it, week after week after
week, I grew to enjoy it more and more and more. I began to see
reminders of it everywhere I looked. I spotted echoes of its style in
the speech of friends who are fans of Wallace. It began, very subtly, to
infect my own speech and writing. The topics it covered touched me to
the core, changing my outlook on deep issues such as religion. By the
time I reached the very last page I emerged, bruised and weary, but also
tremendously excited - I actually flipped it right back and re-read the
first few chapters all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for perhaps the greatest test to date of my supposedly
subjectivity-proof rating system. Here goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/10: If you are ready for a challenge, that entertains and wrenches in
equal measure, stretching you, changing your definitions, taking you on
a tour of regions you never knew existed. It will make you laugh and it
will make you cry. It will leave you a different person than when you
began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0/10: If you can't be bothered.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>book</category><category>drugs</category><category>fiction</category><category>media</category><category>mental-health</category><category>novel</category><category>wallace</category><guid>https://tartley.com/posts/infinite-jest/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 28 Mar 2009 21:26:49 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Doors of Perception</title><link>https://tartley.com/posts/the-doors-of-perception/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float: left"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Aldus Huxley, 1954&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"...the draperies are living hieroglyphs that stand in some peculiarly
expressive way for the unfathomable mystery of pure being. More even
than the chair, though less perhaps than those wholly supernatural
flowers, the folds of my gray flannel trousers were charged with
'is-ness.'"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fairly standard trip report then, albeit one from a relatively astute
and articulate 1950s traveller. Presumably this will therefore be exactly as
fascinating or tedious as the prospect of such a thing leads you to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I forgot to mention the amusing trivia that this is the
essay &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_doors"&gt;Jim Morrison's band&lt;/a&gt; was
named after. Did everyone know this except me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating 6/10 : No truer nor more deeply insightful word has ever been
written in the English language. Yawn.&lt;/p&gt;
