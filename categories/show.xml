&lt;p&gt;Another of my occasional theatre trips inspired by &lt;a href="http://libbypenn.com"&gt;the
Libster&lt;/a&gt;, and jolly lovely it was too. Being a bit
of a cultural dolt, I've neither seen nor read Othello before, so while
everyone else was basking in the familiarity of well-crafted dialog, I
was alternately on tenterhooks or else all choked up, bless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiwetel Ejiofor (left), known to me only through his part in the
geekspasm of Serenity, presented a warm and charismatic Othello, which
served to highlight his later descent into jealousy and madness. The
treachery of Ewan McGregor's Iago seemed unjustified within the context
of the play itself - is it to be assumed that Iago is motivated by
simple racism, or something more explicitly framed which passed me by?
Nevertheless, McGregor's Shakespearean debut seemed to me to be a
compelling performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the director's use of light and shadow to represent various
locations, as well as the acoustics, which augmented several of Iago's
scheming monologues with an imperceptible bass rumble, which gradually
rose to a ominous distant roaring, as though the engines of his inner
demons were fit to burst through the walls. I also fancy I caught
changes in the properties of a very gentle electronically injected
reverb on the actor's voices, to model the auditory properties of each
scene's environment, which provided subtle but deeply suggestive cues as
to the size and type of each setting, from small stone rooms, large
wooden halls, through to outdoor environments deadened by foliage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 8/10 - Hurrah I loved it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>fiction</category><category>media</category><category>show</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/othello-donmar-warehouse/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jan 2008 02:04:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Hothouse</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/the-hothouse/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float: left"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Harold Pinter, 1958.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Directed by Ian Rickson.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;At the National Theatre's Lyttelton theatre.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was forewarned is typical of Pinter, difficult to untangle a point,
but nevertheless both chilling and amusing in turns. Having said that,
I'd really have to go and read all about it before I could decide
whether I actually liked it or not, which I guess means that currently I
don't. 4/10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week was full of great artistic experiences, but none so sublime as
these two masterpieces, which I was lucky enough to witness and
complete, respectively, in the last few days. For reasons that I'm sure
need no explanation, I've opted to review them side-by-side in a single
post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/03/nes_super_mario_bros.png"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;: Pushkin's original novel, seen here in the English translation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of Onegin derives from a Russian novel-in-verse, &lt;em&gt;Eugene
Onegin&lt;/em&gt; written by Aleksandr Pushkin over the period from 1823 to 1837.
It was considered a classic of Russian literature, well-loved enough to
be quoted from memory by most Russians. Forty years later, Tchaikovsky
and Konstantin Shilovsky created the music and libretto respectively for
an operatic version of the same tale. This opera was then choreographed
as a ballet by Cranko in 1965, and it is Stolze's 2007 arrangement of
this that is now playing at the Royal Opera House in London's Covent
Garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/03/eugeneonegin-book.jpg"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;: Super Mario Bros. on the NES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Super Mario Bros, similarly, represents the culmination of a
venerated franchise. The character of Mario first appeared as a nameless
16x16 pixel carpenter in the vintage arcade hit &lt;em&gt;Donkey Kong&lt;/em&gt; (1981),
and was then retooled as a plumber and christened for &lt;em&gt;Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;
(1983). The core gameplay mechanics of the Mushroom Kingdom were not
formulated until &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; (1985), but have formed backbone to
the series ever since. Mario has adapted nimbly to several new
generations of home consoles and handhelds, but the most significant
technical evolution came with &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; (1996), which made a
superlative triumph out of the difficult transition to 3D, one that
continues to stymie many of his
&lt;a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/12/13/what-funk-is-sega-in/"&gt;contemporaries&lt;/a&gt;
even to this day. Meanwhile, Mario continues to form the iconic mainstay
character in what is generally recognised as the most successful, and
certainly the most influential, videogame series of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/03/jump.jpg"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;: Flawlessly timed triple jumps result in extra height.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like so many other DS outings, New Super Mario Bros. is very much a
return to form for the champion platformer. It makes solid, competent
use of the DS's dual screens and touch-sensitive technology, and brings
together the highlights of its distinguished lineage: peerless standards
of level design; an endearing levity; crisp, unambiguous graphics; a
roster of nostalgically well-known characters with their various
abilities and affiliations, and of course the pixel-perfect precision of
control that is the very embodiment of Mario. On top of the traditional
2D Mario mechanics, Nintendo have applied their usual expertise,
seamlessly incorporating moves from &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; et al, enriching
and polishing the control scheme, while never complicating it.
Wall-jumps, a ground-pound, and a triple-jump, complete with a couple of
cheerily superficial somersaults. Never has a controller been so
unintimidatingly overloaded with kinetic potential - latent at at first,
but blossoming by the third act, when Tatiana, now grown into a charming
and sophisticated woman, introduces her husband, Prince Gremin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narrative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both works have in common the attempt to convey a narrative without the
aid of verbiage, with significant difficulties encountered in each case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/03/1703471_onegin_150a.jpg"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;: Dumb, as in mime.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballet suffers from an inexpressiveness in this regard, insomuch as the
tools at the dancer's disposal are not capable of depicting much in the
way of nuanced or fine-grained detail outside of particular,
well-trodden areas. Characters may meet, part, or die, and express all
manner of elation or sorrow as they go about it, but there are only a
limited number of stories that can be told from such components. It is
difficult to imagine, say, a political thriller, or even something as
familiar and staid as a murder mystery being told without resorting to
&lt;em&gt;Spandau&lt;/em&gt; ballet. Because of this, the medium as a whole seems to have
become something of a creative cul-de-sac, preoccupied with retelling
the same formulaic stories over and over again - and even these are
considered to be in need of supplementing with a written synopsis in the
program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/03/newsupermario.jpg"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;: Disrupting the narrative direction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, videogames revolve around the participation of the player,
who thus has the means to disrupt any narrative direction or pacing
anticipated by the game designer. Whatever story can be told, must
perforce be introduced either by the forced insertion of jarringly
ungamelike exposition, during which the player is frustratingly robbed
of any real input, or else must be told using the limited demonstrative
repertoire of in-game action. New Super Mario Bros. sidesteps these
difficulties by eschewing all but the most perfunctory storyline, aside
from a grown-up nod to the sordid realities behind Bowser's recurrent
princess kidnapping, hinted at by Bowser Jr. labouring under the
impression than Princess Peach may be his mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall Impressions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their weaknesses, each of these works represents a good, solid
entry in representing the best that the mainstream of their respective
fields have to offer. Two marvellous, vigorous and thoroughly enjoyable
outings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Onegin&lt;/strong&gt;
Rating 8/10.
An education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Super Mario Bros.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I promised myself I'd endure no more musicals, but somehow an exception
seems appropriate for this beautiful idiocy. Sometimes muppets can say
what men cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 7/10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>fiction</category><category>media</category><category>music</category><category>show</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/avenue-q/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Mar 2007 15:00:20 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>London Symphony Orchestra's Brass Ensemble</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/london-symphony-orchestras-brass-ensemble/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LSO is enjoying a sustained peak of success, and is apparently
well-known for the talented and distinctive timbre of their brass
section, so it was with some interest that I found myself ushered along
to this opportunity to hear them strut their stuff from centre stage,
unencumbered by the rest of the orchestra. It was my first visit to the
2,000 seat Barbican Hall, which as venues go could not be in sharper
contrast to the Royal Albert Hall which hosted Susan and my last
orchestral outing. Along with most people, I wince at the heavy-handed
post-war modernist lines of its exterior, but nevertheless can't help
but admire the boldness and consistency with which such ambitious
architectural and social vision was applied to the entirely of the
enourmous Barbican Estate within which it nestles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And being modern isn't all bad, because the manifold engineered
improvements to the concert hall's acoustics of the last couple of
decades seem very much to have produced the desired effect - I would
describe the clarity and range of sound to which my inexperienced ear
was subjected as nothing short of startling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ten-strong array of trumpets, trombones and tuba played a selection
to showcase their respective talents, with a zest and levity that I am
informed is their usual stock in trade, including Paul Archibald's brass
arrangement of Prokofiev's Ten Pieces for Piano, Op 12; Saint-Saëns'
Carnival of the Animals; Debussy's Keyboard Pieces; James Maynard's
Zoology and Gershwin's Porgy and Bess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not being overly familiar with orchestral music, the thing that struck
me was how much the exercise seemed to celebrate the precision and
craftsmanship that the musicians could bring to bear on the reproduction
of the music, rather than the sheer visceral joy of the music itself
which so predominag tes at a pop gig or night club. I'm told in no
uncertain terms by those with more experience of brass ensembles that
the experience of rhapsody is equally present, but I'm having trouble
reconciling that with my impressions of an audience which was captivated
and delighted, but also entirely motionless for the entire performance.
Somehow in my mind, the idea of overwhelming musical ecstasy is
inseparably associated with a irresistible, participatory physical
motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly I have much to learn. Baby steps. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>media</category><category>show</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/london-symphony-orchestras-brass-ensemble/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Mar 2007 04:59:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The History Boys</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/the-history-boys/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2007/03/the-history-boys.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Director: Nicholas Hytner.
Theatre: Wyndham's.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a lengthy run at the National Theatre, and then a national tour,
this production marks the play's return to the West End, enlivened by a
new cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tale revolves around a class of bright and boisterous schoolboys,
under the tutelage of two particular teachers; Hector, a middle-aged
General Studies teacher, who spurns the concept of curriculum and
examinations in favour of individual intellectual exploration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The school gives them an education. I give them the wherewithal to
resist it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;versus a younger, more efficient History teacher, focussed on a more
prescriptive methodology, providing a palette of intellectual
sleights-of-hand designed specifically to get them through the Oxbridge
entrance exams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Director Hytner effectively introduces the play, and many scenes within
it, using short video clips of the characters within school settings,
set to gleefully evocative gems of 1980's pop. This immersed me in
memories of Grange Hill and my own school days even before the first
line, and the rest of the play rolled on in a similarly involving,
humorous and touching manner. From its initial premise, the story
expands to subject the cast to a gamut of emotions, including (spoiler
warning) a thoughtful yet uncomplicated exploration of recurrent sexual
abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pupils enact occasional scenes from classic movies with mock
gravity, notably selected to highlight the famously British trend of
repressed emotion, and in many ways that is a recurrent theme of the
play, the way emotions are hidden, redirected and how they then come
out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, smashing and involving - time well spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 7/10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>fiction</category><category>media</category><category>show</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/the-history-boys/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2007 17:26:06 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
