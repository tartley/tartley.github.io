<p><em>by Neal Stephenson, 2021</em></p>
<p>It's another 720-page doorstop from the much-beloved author (which is actually
slightly slimmer than his average book, which would be 770 pages). It was
enjoyable, but not life changing. Not as compelling as some of his previous.
Reads a lot like a narrative wrapped around the author's own personal
justifications for pro-active geo-engineering projects. Which, I have to admit,
I was pretty horrified by the idea when I first heard about it - meddling
further with a critical and horrifically complex dynamic system that we don't
undertand, and all that.</p>
<p>The story presents the the scenario of countering the temperature rise caused
by CO2 in the atmosphere by releasing high altitude sulphur dioxide, to reflect
sunlight back into space. This mitigates many of the most prominent effects of
climate change, such as high-temperatures, storms, forest fires, and sea-level
rises.</p>
<p>It further presents the idea that it's relatively easy and cheap to do, and
some nation or part thereof that cares the most - e.g. The Netherlands, or
Venice, amongst others, will either take a crack at it, or else will cease to
exist. So we might as well get used to the idea and be prepared for what,
geopolitically, happens after that.</p>
<p>I don't know if it's simply the story making me increasingly familiar with the
idea, or whether the depiction of the mechanism genuinely quells some of my
worries, in that it seems easy to start at a small scale, monitor the results,
scale up as required, and the fail-safe is that the sulphur should quickly fall
out of the air, allegedly harmlessly, if we realize this was a bad idea. I've
at least tempered my initial harshly negative viewpoint somewhat. So, mission
accomplished, I guess?</p>
<p>I've probably read more text by Stephenson than any other writer. Hmmm. By
Goodreads page counts:</p>

<p>Ten thousand pages, all from one author, or fifteen thousand if you include
re-reads. Not bad! The number of re-reads is a reasonable proxy for the impact
each book had on me at the time.</p>

<p><em>Written by Alejandro Jodorowsky, art by Jean Giraud (aka MÅ“bius), 1980-88</em></p>
<p>I grabbed this in the English translation from the original French, having been
intrigued by the <em>Pocket Essential Alan Moore</em>'s description of it as a
contender for "the best comic in the medium's history".</p>
<p>This creative pairing also worked together on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodorowsky%27s_Dune">the unproduced 1970s movie of Dune</a>,
the one whose cast was to have included Salvador DalÃ­, Orson Welles,
Gloria Swanson, and Mick Jagger, and presumably would have been pretty trippy -
I mean, <em>even more</em> trippy than the David Lynch one turned out to be. The
artist, MÅ“bius, has had a long and glorious career, knighted for his art in his
native France, and he worked on other movies such as Alien, Tron, The Fifth
Element, and The Abyss.</p>
<p>Echoes of all of these are visible throughout the consistently stunning
artwork of The Incal, and it has been explicitly noted as an influence on the
expansive decayed futurescapes of Akira and Blade Runner, and the flamboyant
visuals of the Star Wars prequels.</p>
<p>The writing really swings for the fences, a sprawling tale of a reluctant
hero's journey, taking in societal commentary, intergalactic travel, spiritual
transformation, iconic incarnations of good and evil, and a deep thread of
mysticism.</p>
<p>For me, it does have a very evident "foreign" feeling - small social nuances
with which I'm unfamiliar. Equally clearly, this is part of its exotic charm.
And while the story touches on, perhaps even consists of, deep themes, it
doesn't so much articulately explore them, but instead simply incorporates
them. This is not a comic for people who are not already comic fans.</p>
<p>In lesser hands, it might have been undisciplined. But wherever the story
roams, the artwork is endlessly enthralling. I especially liked the touch of
protagonist, John DiFool, starting out distinctly ugly, but being rendered more
handsomely on the rare occasions he manages to get in touch with his more noble
aspects. Jodorowsky manages to keep it all together, bringing it around to a
splendidly satisfying theatrical close. <em>Bravo!</em></p>

<p><em>by Kazuo Ishiguro, 2021</em> <img alt="spoilers" src="files/spoilers.svg"></p>
<p>This was just wonderful to read.</p>
<p>The near-future scenario is revealed in a compellingly minimal way, teased
in minor details. Eventually we piece together an epidemic of children without
siblings, born into a competitive, authoritarian society. Higher-rank parents
are able to purchase artificial friends, to help with the rigors of
socialization. Klara, a newly activated artificial friend, demonstrates a lack
of experience in dealing with human situations, but her efforts are
unstinting, to understand what is going on within the family to whom she is
sold, and do her best for them. Her earnest naivety as a narrator only
serves to magnify the emotional impacts of the story, as her keen but
inexperienced observation conveys everything we need to know about the
dysfunctions of her tragic new family. She describes
herself as feeling emotions, so the story is partly a discussion of what it
means to be concious, to feel, as the humans around her are forced by
circumstance into desperate schemes that expose the self-protective
aspects of their love.</p>
<p>For all that, though, I'm not sure what to take away from it. Clearly the
author is very skilled. It seems likely that metaphors are at work here. But,
lunk that I am, I'm unable to discern what they are.</p>
<p>I'm fairly sure that the "boxes" Klara sometimes relates her perceptions being
divided into are just stylish flair - a reference to the ways in which her
brain works differently from ours, calving off processing into separate
processors, or some-such, which comes to the fore when she is under stress,
or deciphering complex emotions. I don't <em>think</em> this strikingly non-literal
aspect is indicative of any deeper symbolism.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I fail to pick up on metaphor, it's because religious
allegory is involved. Beyond tales of mere personal transcendence, my brain
just isn't wired that way. I can see that Klara is in many ways an innocent.
Free not only of wrongdoing, but also of wishing harm, and - being made, not
born - of original sin. On the literal level, this is emotionally
resonant, especially when Klara's heroic contribution to the family is
rewarded by being uncomplainingly discarded, like an appliance, at the end of
the book.</p>
<p>But is this related to the other big clue about things I'm not picking up on -
the title? I'm at a loss of what to make about Klara's relationship with the
sun, which is a central plot point. Was Klara's bargain with her Sun god
literally answered by a special burst of healing light, that saved her family's
child from terminal illness? Certainly that is how Klara relates it. Could she
perhaps have been imagining this? Might the recovery have been fated to happen
anyway, and Klara's association with the burst of sunlight was all in her head?
But the text tells us that the rest of the household are awestruck by the
brilliance and beauty of that particular sunbeam, not just Klara. Later on, the
questions Rick asks of Klara show that, although he does not understand, he has
guessed the significance of the moment.</p>
<p>So. Klara the innocent's anthropomorphized Sun god's healing powers are real,
and He answers her prayers to save the life of a child. And I don't know what
to make of that.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I'm in good company. A quick search does yield intelligent writing
about the book, but I don't see anyone coming up with aspects or metaphors
that I've entirely overlooked - although that is usually quite fruitful when I
search about other books that puzzle me. So I venture that I'm not the only one
who doesn't get it.</p>

<p>I've never before memorized the complete set of tricks needed to solve a
rubik's cube... until today! My first completion with no reference to my notes
took 3 minutes and 5 seconds. Wine and chocolate motivators as pictured.</p>
<p>Rubik's cubes first came out outside Hungary in 1980, when I was 9. A year or
two after that, I got my hands on an nth generation photocopy of handwritten
instructions for solving one, derived by a mathematically-inclined friend of a
friend of my Dad. (The things we used to do before the internet!)</p>
<p>I memorized the first few phases, so have always been able to do the first two
layers. But the last parts of that solution involved remembering a couple of 15
or 20 move sequences, which apparently ten-year-old me got bored of, or
distracted from, before ever committing to memory.</p>
<p>It turns out that
<a href="https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/how-to-solve-the-rubiks-cube-beginners-method/">the modern "beginner's method"</a>
that I'm reading about today is considerably simpler than that, and is
much easier to understand and memorize. So now that lingering childhood
inadequacy is vanquished.</p>

    <p>Got sick of navigating the limitations of various online services to create
animated gif memes, finally figured out how to do it manually. Not a universal
process, just what worked for my situation. (Which is Ubuntu 21.10, "Impish".)</p>
<p>All of of the ffmpeg invocations could probably be combined into one, but I
show the commands as I used them, as I was figuring each step out.</p>
<h4>1. Download a video</h4>
<p>Starting from a video on YouTube:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6-gJMs6DwuE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p></p>

<p>To download this locally,
<a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl">install <code>youtube-dl</code></a>,
hit the YouTube <em>share</em> button to grab the video's encoded URL,
and:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">youtube-dl https://youtu.be/6-gJMs6DwuE -o Ash.mp4
</pre></div>

<p>This gives me an 850KB .mp4 video file.</p>
<h4>2. Split</h4>
<p>I only want the final few seconds. To remove the start of the video,
keeping from 6.5 seconds until the end:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ffmpeg -hide_banner -i Ash.mp4 -acodec copy -vcodec libx264 -ss 00:00:06.5 Ash-split.mp4
</pre></div>

<p>Args to ffmpeg are position sensitive. Specifying '-ss' (to split the file)
before the input ('-i') can't create the split at an accurate location, since
it has to guess whereabouts in the file the given timestamp will occur. But
putting it after the input (as done here) means it can split accurately on the
given timestamp, since the file has been processed by the time this arg gets
actioned, so accurate timestamp/frame conversion is known, at the cost of
having had to process even the parts of the video that are then discarded.</p>
<p>Vcodec of libx264 is specified because, according to stackoverflow,
"<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5651654/ffmpeg-how-to-split-video-efficiently#comment85070704_13289426">scenes in mp4 are broken</a>", whatever that means,
and specifying "copy", as most people do, gives me an output with no video,
only audio.</p>
<p>This results in a three second, 217KB .mp4 video file. (the following is just an
image of it).</p>
<p><img alt="ash-split.webp" src="files/2021/ash-split.webp"></p>
<h4>3. Crop</h4>
<p>To crop out the black bars from the top and bottom:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ffmpeg -hide_banner -i Ash-split.mp4 -vf 'crop=iw:365' Ash-split-crop.mp4
</pre></div>

<p>Here, we crop it to the input width "iw", and 365 high. In the absense of
any offset ordinates for the crop, ffmpeg defaults to centering them, so this
365 pixels are taken from the (spatial, vertical) middle of the video, which is
exactly what we want.</p>
<p>This results in a three second, 220KB .mp4 video file.</p>
<p><img alt="ash-split-crop.webp" src="files/2021/ash-split-crop.webp"></p>
<h3>4. Resize and convert to gif</h3>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="s s-Atom">ffmpeg</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="s s-Atom">hide_banner</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="s s-Atom">i</span> <span class="nv">Ash</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="s s-Atom">split</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="s s-Atom">crop</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="s s-Atom">mp4</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="s s-Atom">vf</span> <span class="s s-Atom">'scale=512:-1'</span> <span class="nv">Ash</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="s s-Atom">split</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="s s-Atom">crop</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="s s-Atom">resize</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="s s-Atom">gif</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This results in a grainy-but-passable three second 750KB animated .gif:</p>
<p><img alt="ash-split-crop-resize.gif" src="files/2021/ash-split-crop-resize.gif"></p>
<p>The file size can be smaller, if you care, most easily by splitting a shorter
video clip, reducing the frame rate, or reducing the 'scale' in this step.</p>
<p>Alternately, this could be done using ImageMagik's 'convert', but the result
of that was a very large (10MB) file and played very slowly, and I wasn't
immediately sure how to fix that.</p>
<h3>5. Add text</h3>
<p>Using Imagemagik's 'convert':</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">convert \
    Ash-split-crop-resize.gif \
    -coalesce \
    -font impact -pointsize 36 -fill white -stroke black -strokewidth 2 \
    -gravity north -annotate +0+0 'I can''t lie about your chances, but' \
    -gravity south -annotate +0+0 'you have my sympathies' \
    -layers Optimize \
    Ash-split-crop-resize-text.gif
</pre></div>

<p>The '-coalesce' option removes all the .gif optimizations, then we apply the
text labels, then the '-layers' option re-applies optimizations. Without this
dance, the text is all twitchy and messy.</p>
<p>VoilÃ . Imagine sending it to a co-worker who is taking on a difficult task,
like making changes to that thorny section of the codebase that nobody likes:</p>
<p><img alt="ash-split-crop-resize-text.gif" src="files/2021/ash-split-crop-resize-text.gif"></p>

<p><a href="https://subnautica.fandom.com/wiki/Subnautica_Wiki">Subnautica</a>,
and its icy sequel,
"<a href="https://subnautica.fandom.com/wiki/Subnautica:_Below_Zero">Below Zero</a>",
have perhaps been my favorite
games of the last few years. The majority of their run time takes place under
the colorful waters of an alien ocean. It's been a joy to sit side-by-size
with Zander for tense scuba cave dives, or piloting vehicles through
vertiginous underwater cave systems, headlights straining through the murk to
reveal wonders. It has inspired
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_Below_Zero/comments/r82l3i/birthday_cake_no_spoilers/">cake</a>.</p>
<p>Part of the games take place on land though. I <em>started</em> drawing a map of Below
Zero's Glacial Basin region just to keep track of where we'd been. To make sure
we visited all the locations, found all the MacGuffins (I'm looking at <em>you</em>,
pesky antidote), and experienced all that there was to experience.</p>
<p>But as those goals approached completion, I <em>finished</em> drawing it because it
had become a therapeutic experience. Happily exploring away, mesmerised by the
scenery, avoiding hostile wildlife, uncovering the ruins of ancient alien
artifacts. Reckoning distances by eye, scribbling down what we found, updating
and correcting the map as we went. Being lost in the experience. Simply a joy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_Below_Zero/comments/qutkqz/hand_drawn_map_of_southern_glacial_region_wip/">Reddit is encouraging me</a>
to tackle the tricky Actic Spires area, too. <em>&lt;Rubs hands&gt;...</em></p>
