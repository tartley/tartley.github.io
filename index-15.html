<p>Are you a <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> geek?</p>
<p>For starters - you should totally be going to
<a href="http://www.europython.eu/">EuroPython</a> at the end of June. Python
conferences like this attract brilliant presentations from some real
community and industry heavyweights. This year we've got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare">Professor Sir
Tony Hoare</a> (that's the creator
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">quicksort</a> to you, amongst a
venerable lifetime's worth of other
things); <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/hugunin/"></a> <a href="http://craphound.com/">Cory
Doctorow</a> (everyone's favourite science-fiction
author, blogger and all-round geek activist), <a href="http://www.mindviewinc.com/Index.php">Bruce
Eckel</a> (author and renowned
technical communicator); plus Dr Sue Black from code-breaking hothouse
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_park">Bletchley Park</a>. The
<a href="http://www.europython.eu/talks/timetable/">veritable horde</a> of over 100
exciting and interesting talks makes up probably the strongest line-up
EuroPython has ever had.</p>
<p>Best of all, Python conferences like this one are organised and run at a
grass-roots level. By enthusiasts, for enthusiasts, making them quite
the most fun, educational and interestingly social conferences I've ever
been to. Personally, I love the resultant absence of overriding
commercial agendas - everything is done purely for the benefit of the
delegates, and is pervaded by the community values that made you love
Python in the first place.</p>
<p>One upside of this is that the conference is cheap - only £190 to
attend. Interested enthusiasts can easily pay their own way. As a
result, this is one of the few technical conferences that still has a
robust attendance this year - both of presenters and delegates. Many
others have been decimated or even cancelled altogether.</p>
<p>There is a downside though, and here's the rub:</p>
<p>The good folks organising EuroPython in their spare time are desperately
short of volunteers to be session chairs.</p>
<p>If you're going to EuroPython, you could help out! Yes, YOU! You could
sign up for the sessions you want to watch anyway, so you shouldn't miss
anything. Just imagine the warm and fuzzies! The KUDOS of a roomful of
eyes. The POWER of cutting off over-running speakers in mid-flow*. The
WARMTH of a deftly-cupped microphone.</p>
<p>(*anyone cutting the power on Sir Tony will be duly ejected from the
premises)</p>
<p>Responsibilities are described in loving detail here:
<a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/SessionTeam">http://wiki.europython.eu/SessionTeam</a></p>
<p>Please think about it, and if you fancy it, sign up soon (on the wiki
page above) because we're currently all a-flutter wondering how the heck
we're going to manage this. :-)</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<img alt="OpenGL Shading Language cover" src="files/2009/05/opengl-shading-language.jpg"></span></p>
<p><em>by Randi J. Rost (2nd Edtion, 2006)</em></p>
<p>I've had a hobbyist interest in computer graphics for years, but had
avoided the technology of <em>shaders</em> these last few years, thinking that
they were just another layer of complexity which I didn't need to embark
upon while I was still getting to grips with the standard OpenGL API.</p>
<p>With hindsight, I was wrong. I was recently cajoled into getting on
board after talking to <a href="http://blog.vrplumber.com/">Mike Fletcher</a>
(creator of <a href="http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/">PyOpenGL</a>) after his talk
at PyCon, and now I feel as if I should have read this book years ago.
Shaders solve many of the problems I've been happily messing with for
ages, in ways that are easier to implement, more powerful, and more
performant.</p>
<p>I <a href="opengl-programming-guide-6th-ed">whined about the Red Book</a>, but this
"Orange" OpenGL Shading Language book is brill - just what I needed.
Incisive without being overly terse, practical, and once it got into the
chapters about applications of multidimensional Perlin noise it got me
all hot'n'bothered about computer graphics again. Yay my inner geek!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I started this book fascinated by using vertex shaders to
transform geometry on the fly, with little interest in the superficial
fragment shaders used to decorate the rendered surfaces with pretty
images or lighting effects. Since finishing it, this has reversed: I've
become obsessed with noise and Fourier transforms and all the
paraphernalia of fragment shaders, imagining relatively simple fragment
shader that could, I believe, provide a surface with infinite levels of
detail. I dreamed about my old university 'Signals &amp; Systems' type
lectures. Uncanny.</p>
<p><strong>Update2:</strong> Ohdear. Once I started trying to write anything more than
the most trivial of my own shaders, I ran into an unexpected problem. My
shaders just wouldn't link. I couldn't figure out why. The book was no
help. <em>Google</em> was no help. The error messages <em>certainly</em> weren't any
help (thanks ATI.) Eventually I realised that the 'built-in' noise
functions which are part of the OpenGL shader language are simply not
implemented by the vast majority of graphics card manufacturers - you
have to roll your own. Which is not a major deal-breaker, but what
<em>is</em> disappointing is that the OpenGL Shader Language book makes
absolutely no mention of this in any of the chapters plural in which it
lovingly describes the built-in noise functions, along with their
characteristics and uses. Perhaps I spoke too soon when praising the
book. Maybe it is another case of idealistic OpenGL theory that has
something of a disconnect with real world development. Maybe the book
was written before this situation came to pass - regardless, it's no
bloody use to me.</p>
<p>Rating (oh, how I love my new rating system. Check this one out:)</p>
<p>10/10 if you want to learn <em>the theory of</em> how to use the OpenGL shader
language.</p>
<p>0/10 if you don't.</p>

<p>Against my better
judgement I couldn't help but snag a torrent of this. Sure enough, as
the opening credits kicked in, my housemates assured us it was rubbish.</p>
<p>But then what happened is that I proceeded to love it. Clearly it
polarises. The whole thing is shot in a shaky handicam held by one of
the characters - imagine Blair Witch meets 9/11, only it isn't
terrorists, it's a giant, evil <em>whatthefuckisthat</em> stalking the streets
of NYC. It reminds me of
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390384/"><em>Primer</em></a>, in which the script is
so realistic and lacking in over-ripe gravitas that, unusually, the
actors don't even look like they are acting! What a concept. Well this
is similar - albeit a lot dumber - but the strength is not in the
script, which isn't especially strong, but is in the novel method of
presentation.</p>
<p>There's clearly a limited number of movies that could be made like this,
but for me, it was a welcome respite from the staged set-pieces of
Hollywood's more conventional output. The sense of panic and confusion
was beautifully heightened by the total lack of exposition - viewers
only get to see what this small group of characters get to see, and even
that is in blurry and imperfect fragmetary snatches. The monster, when
it is even visible, is only glimpsed from afar. It was the closest a
movie has ever come to creating the kind of tense, terrifying immersion
that really great computer games can create.</p>
<p>I was amused to note that a bridge they take shelter under at the end
looks exactly like the bridge they took shelter under at the end of The
Day The Earth Stood Still (2008) - do all the bridges in Central Park
look the same, or does this one have some special meaning? Anyhow, the
final scene is saddening and telegraphed quite plainly from the opening
shot (<em>Camera retrieved at incident site US 447. Area formerly known as
"Central Park"</em>) and it makes me weep with relief that a movie could so
willing try and break the mold.</p>
<p>Rating:</p>
<p>0/10 if you're not into monster flicks, or if handycam footage makes you
vomit.</p>
<p>10/10 If you fancy being scared silly by a giant alien monster.</p>

<p>Sometimes when programming I like to leave unit tests running
repeatedly in one window while editing the code and tests in another.
The bash command <code>watch</code> is useful for this, and can highlight the
differences between one invocation and the next in
inverse.</p>
<p>I wanted a version of <code>watch</code> for use on Windows, so I whipped up a
quick Python script,
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/testwatcher/">testwatcher</a>, which produces
output very similar to watch, but is cross-platform, and features not
just inverse text, but <em>yellow</em> inverse text. Woo-hoo!</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>$ python example_test.py

_
</code></pre>

<p>Incidentally, the above test makes it very clear that Python objects in
successive processes get new addresses on Linux, but interestingly on
Windows the same addresses seems to get re-used for different processes.</p>
<p>I can't help but suspect this is a dumb script to have written - it
should only be a:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code> <span class="k">while</span> <span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">command</span>
</code></pre>

<p>but in order to shoehorn the inverse text and colors in, it's grown to
300 lines - a hideous bloat for a minor superficial thrill. Plus the
Windows version flickers terribly - I'm currently using <code>system('cls')</code>
to clear the screen and then redraw it every second. I'll do some
searching for better ways to do it.</p>
<p>However - I've long wanted a Python interface to perform simple terminal
actions like colors and animation on different platforms (the standard
library 'curses' module that would otherwise do the job is simply not
implemented on Windows.) So maybe it's time I used this script as an
excuse to figure this out. Suggestions welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> This idea may have now reached a viable fruition

<p>The Earth obligingly stood still for us twice this week, on back-to-back
nights. In each, a lone alien man arrives in a spaceship with his giant
robot buddy Gort, to tell humans that they must mend their destructive
ways or be destroyed.</p>
<p>The 1951 version was very Fifties - intrusively hopeless special
effects, and seems to my eyes to be riddled with outlandish social
etiquette and hopelessly naive politics. I suppose in the years
following World War II any platform for preaching pacifism seemed worth
a shot. If only more people considered it worth preaching today. I
completely missed the Christian allegory that permeates the movie until
it was pointed out to me: The alien comes from the heavens, and lives
amongst common people, taking the name 'Carpenter' to blend in. He
preaches peace to humankind, or else warns we will suffer a fiery
apocalypse. He is our intermediary to 'Gort' (in fact the servant of
Gort, in the original script) who later resurrects him from the dead, so
that he may deliver his final message before being taken back up into
the skies. Cute if you're into that, I guess.</p>
<p>Equally predictably, the 2008 version was very Naughties. Intrusively
overblown production values string together a mediochre script. The
pacifism and Christian message of the original has been replaced with a
more timely environmental message - the writers perhaps intuiting that
modern Americans are not so receptive to anti-war talk. Otherwise the
scope and potential of the ideas at play are completely wasted - lost
amidst the creative wasteland of a budget that could no doubt have fed
countries. Once provoked, Gort unleashes self-replicating insectile
microbots, which swarm and consume Philly, spreading fast. At the last
moment, Keanu / Klaatu sees some humans hugging and crying, and has a
big change of heart - the Earth deserves to be spared, after all. What a
crock.</p>
<p>So there you have it. Watch this space for more reviews from me -
wasting nights of my life, so that you don't have to. Final ratings:</p>
<p>10/10 if you are a stump-sucking mealy-mouthed pig-dog with googly eyes.</p>
<p>0/10 if you have any vestigial glimmers of taste or discernment.</p>

and I've been wracked with guilt ever since because I apparently lost it
soon after. Thankfully, it recently turned up (on
<a href="http://babbageclunk.com/">Christian</a>'s desk - my fault!) last week, so
I happily finished it pronto.</p>
<p>It's his best fiction yet! He must be honing his abilities with
practice. \o/ Michael do you want it next?.</p>
<p>Christian doesn't like my subjectivity-proof rating system, so this one
is specially for him.</p>
<p>Rating:</p>
<p>10/10 if you want a lightly styled but deeply speculative and engrossing
story that winds a like a sightseeing tour around the social and
personal ramifications of the ways in which modern technology is
changing the way people interact, organise and get things done.</p>
<p>0/10: If you aren't interested in the ways society is changing under our
feet.</p>

<p><em>by Lawrence Lessig</em>, 2008.</p>
<p>Is creating a mix CD for a friend an act of creativity, or a criminal
offence? When you shoot a home video of your child which has a TV on in
the background, is there really any need for lawsuits? What business do
federal laws have in trying to regulate this sort of activity anyway?</p>
<p>For those, like me, who view modern copyright law as a morass of
intractable problems, irreconcilable interests, overreaching government
intervention and profoundly unfair restrictions on personal freedoms,
Professor Lessig's words are a welcome infusion of clarity, pragmatism
and respect for all interested parties.</p>
<p>With an engaging and accessible style, he describes exactly what is
wrong with modern copyright, with clarity and impartiality, and why this
is a deep and pervasive problem that cuts to the heart of all that we
value in human culture. He describes how fixing this would benefit each
of us, from individual consumers and amateur producers, through
professional writers, musicians and copyright holders. Then, in a
surprisingly constructive final section, he outlines five simple changes
to copyright law that would, at a stroke, fix all the major problems,
vastly simplify the situation, eliminate the ambiguity over the legality
of our everyday actions, and all without apparently causing any harm or
loss to any interested party.</p>
<p>Rating:</p>
<p>10/10 If you have any interest in the forces that are reshaping our
society and turning industries upside-down within the space of years.</p>
<p>0/10 If you dislike freedom or free markets, or are a big fan of
overbearing government regulation and monopolies.</p>

<img alt="Inifinite Jest" src="files/2009/02/infinitejest.jpg"></span></p>
<p><em>by David Foster Wallace (1996)</em></p>
<p>I've had such a diverse set of reactions to this, and how could I not?
The writing is bold and idiosyncratic throughout. The novel's story is
not presented in chronological order, and the timeline is obfuscated by
the gleeful adoption of 'subsidised time', in which traditional numeric
monikers denoting each calender year are replaced by the sponsored
labels designated by major corporations - 'Year of the Whopper', and so
on - a marvellous concept which nevertheless makes it completely and
artificially impossible to tell what the hell's going on until about 500
pages in.</p>
<p>The whole novel unashamedly celebrates the author's literary and formal
grammatical credentials - from the extraordinarily-crafted opening
scene, where a tragically misunderstood literary genius disastrously
fails a university entrance interview, with just a hint of a
semi-autobiographical air about him. Scenes of superlative execution are
interspersed with a narrative that is, on the whole, told in the third
person but in the argot of the currently eminent protagonist, leading to
large swathes of the book which are, like, more than conversational in
their familiarity. The combination gives rise to a relentlessly
inventive stream of neology and malapropism.</p>
<p>While the book resoundingly makes many insightful points by the conclusion, the
story which serves as a vehicle for their delivery is, a collision of ideas,
introducing entirely new and unexplored premises at the 11th hour, which
peter out, ignored and unresolved, by the final page. The jest continues
on, I suppose.</p>
<p>The insidious footnotes for which Wallace's writings are well-known do
not serve to streamline the prose by separating out incidental
annotations, but instead seem specifically employed to elevate the
reader's awareness of the footnotes themselves. Including them in the
main body of the text would allow for the possibility of a busy reader
failing to give each pithy addendum it's full, weighty consideration.
Wallace cunningly obviates this possibility, by discreetly giving pause
to any reader assiduously trying to do their best with a challenging
book, requiring them to invoke the titillating ritual of thumbing
forward a literal thousand pages or so, giving an involuntary moment of
rest in the narrative in which the reader may properly anticipate the
mysterious text to be revealed while they dereference the footnote's
numeric identifier, and then a second pause afterwards to properly
digest and appreciate, while they thumb a literal thousand pages back
again to find where they left off. Three hundred and eighty eight times,
no less. Plus sub-footnotes, obviously. Some of these are pages-long
tomes of critically insightful dialog between major characters. Many
others are completely irrelevant technical specifications. I have to
ask, what the fuck is going on here? Does this really make the novel
somehow better? While I laughed and cried about the content of many of
the footnotes, I remain unconvinced by the mechanism of their delivery.</p>
<p>I rant about these aspects of style because these are definitely the
first impressions any reader will have. Getting into the book <a href="http://kottke.org/09/03/growing-sentences-with-david-foster-wallace">does
require a little
work</a>.
But fortunately Wallace more than provides the incentive to do so. The
book ranges over many areas, but is mostly about addiction, in its many
forms, and its relationship to freedom of will and to happiness. These
are deep and interesting topics, and are unflinchingly explored with a
very keen eye. For every one of the annoyances mentioned above, the book
provides powerful rewards for those who stick it out. The
heart-wrenching depictions of people going through the utter destruction
of their humanity are as touching and insightful as anything I have
read.</p>
<p>There are some problems or tasks in life which are small enough that an
individual can overcome them by force of will, grinding down the problem
until it is flattened and overcome. This approach fails, however, when
the problem is too large or too hard. Some problems cannot be crushed by
any individual. To navigate past them requires that, instead of trying
to demolish the problem, the individual must instead mould themselves to
fit around the problem's existing contours. People emerge on the other
side of these experiences triumphant but sober - having been changed to
their core by the experience. I consider <em>Infinite Jest</em> to belong to
this latter class of experience. From the base-camp of its 981 pages
(plus 98 of footnotes), it is intimidating and uncompromising. You love
it and hate it in equal measure, and it makes no attempt to pander to
the former. But as I ploughed on, through it, week after week after
week, I grew to enjoy it more and more and more. I began to see
reminders of it everywhere I looked. I spotted echoes of its style in
the speech of friends who are fans of Wallace. It began, very subtly, to
infect my own speech and writing. The topics it covered touched me to
the core, changing my outlook on deep issues such as religion. By the
time I reached the very last page I emerged, bruised and weary, but also
tremendously excited - I actually flipped it right back and re-read the
first few chapters all over again.</p>
<p>Now for perhaps the greatest test to date of my supposedly
subjectivity-proof rating system. Here goes:</p>
<p>Rating:</p>
<p>10/10: If you are ready for a challenge, that entertains and wrenches in
equal measure, stretching you, changing your definitions, taking you on
a tour of regions you never knew existed. It will make you laugh and it
will make you cry. It will leave you a different person than when you
began.</p>
<p>0/10: If you can't be bothered.</p>

<p>Thursday 19 March 2009</p>
<p>Dear Baroness Ludford, (<strong>Update</strong>: This was sent to all eleven of my
MEPs)</p>
<p>I am writing with reference to the European Parliament's vote on
copyright extension for sound recordings, due to take place on March
23rd.</p>
<p>As you know, this is a complex issue, but I shall try my best to keep
this short, I know you must be busy.</p>
<p>Amongst the justification for this particular extension to the term of
copyrights, is the idea that artists need more protection, particularly
towards the end of their lives when their income from royalties might
dry up as their copyrights expire.</p>
<p>This is misleading in the extreme. Under the current 50 year term, an
artist recording at age 25 will be protected until age 75, and any
artist who records throughout their lifetime will be protected until
many decades beyond their death.</p>
<p>There is no need whatsoever to extend the term in order to benefit or
incentivise artists.</p>
<p>In fact, as everyone knows, artists in practice almost never end up
owning the copyrights to their own works - the labels do. While artists
and labels are aligned in the desire to sell as many records as
possible, they are in direct opposition when it comes to dividing up the
proceeds. The majority of the income from sales goes to the labels,
because they have such an overwhelmingly dominant position of power in
the relationship. No label is reliant upon any individual artist, while
every artist is very much dependant on their label, to whom they are
tied by contract for many years. Strengthening copyright only
strengthens the position of the copyright owner, ie. the labels, at the
expense of what little leverage the artist may have. Extending the term
of copyright only enhances the labels' income, not the artists.</p>
<p>It is not the role of copyright to be a protectionist measure to support
labels who are having to adjust their business models in these times of
great change. The last thing we need to do is to construct laws which
chain Europe's creative industries to last-century modes of operation,
at precisely a time when the current tumult will reveal as yet undreamed
of exciting new ways of doing business.</p>
<p>As you know, copyright is intended to stimulate the creation of new
creative works, by enabling the artist to earn an income from their own
creations.</p>
<p>There exists significant evidence to suggest that stronger copyright may
actually inhibit the production of creative work, by allowing
monopoly-level profits to be reaped from ever smaller amounts of
creative output. The composer Verdi is notable for suddenly decreasing
his creative output when copyright laws over music were introduced in
18th century Italy - his personal correspondence indicates that he
simply had to work less because he was earning more from his earlier
compositions. (note that he retained copyright over his own work.)</p>
<p>Similarly, there is the very vital and oft-overlooked influence of the
creative environment which our society fosters. It could well be that
freedom to borrow and build upon inspiration from other artists is a
vital input to the engines of creativity, and to encourage fledgling
artists. By way of anecdotal evidence I say it would not be very
controversial to suggest that the last great English composer of the
Baroque period was Handel, who coincidentally died around the same year
copyright over music was introduced in England. After that, there is a
dearth of truly top-class composers from England, right up until the
20th century. Meanwhile Germany, too preocupied with invasions and
reforging of the nation to introduce copyright laws over music, went on
to produced greats like Bach, Mozart and Beethoven, in a succession of
creative gear-shifts which formed the romance and classical eras, all
done with no copyright over music. *1</p>
<p>I apologise if I have been unable to express my points very succinctly,
but I hope I have made given you some reasons to consider rejecting this
extension of the copyright term, or at least to consider assessing it in
the light of evidence over its theorised effects, rather than the
deliberately misleading suppositions put forward by those representing
the special interests who stand to directly benefit from the proposal at
the expense of artists and of the rest of society.</p>
<p>With all my gratitude and respect for the work you and your fellow MEPs
have done and will continue to do to resolve these issues,</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Jonathan Hartley</p>
<p>*1 See this February 2009 Harvard paper which notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"An attempt to determine the impact of legal changes on entry into
composing is inconclusive. The paper shows, however, that a golden age
of musical composition nevertheless occurred in nations that
lackedcopyright protection for musical works."</p>
