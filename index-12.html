    <p>Last night was Game Dev night at the London Geek meet in the
ThoughtWorks offices. It was really enjoyable, I really enjoyed the
talks, and meeting and chatting to everyone there.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there were a bunch of comments throughout the evening
that confirmed some long-standing suspicions I've had about professional
game development. I'm not pointedly directing this at any individuals -
it really was a pleasure and an education talking to every person
present. However, I couldn't help but notice that there seems to be a
pervasive macho streak in the game industry, sustained by the belief
that game development is considerably harder and more creative than any
other form of software. Or, as I have overheard game developers saying,
first hand, <em>than any other human endeavor</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Not rocket science</strong></p>
<p>Now, there's no doubt that different niches of the software industry
vary in complexity, just as the commitment and experience of
individuals, teams and organisations varies over an enormous range. I
have no doubt that game development lies on the upper part of that
spectrum rather than in the middle. But I also have no doubt that there
are lots of other software industries which are just as complex,
demanding and creative as game development.</p>
<p>Game dev is not special or unique in having many hard problems to solve.
When game devs claim that it is, it simply looks like a defensive
reaction to the pervasive belief outside the industry that games are
trivial time-wasting distractions, and that creating them must therefore
be one of the easiest and most lightweight aspects of IT.</p>
<p>This would be merely silly self-delusion if that was as far as it went,
but this state of affairs actually has huge damaging knock-on effects.
The belief that they are tackling projects which are harder than other
software projects leads to an attitude verging on arrogance - an
assumption of superiority, and that they have nothing to learn from the
rest of the software industry. As a result, game dev shops don't even
attempt to talk to other software engineers about their common craft,
and as a result the engineering prowess of the game industry actually
<em>lags behind</em> the rest of the software industry by five or ten years.
Practices and techniques which are <em>de rigour</em> in the rest of the
industry these days, such as test-driven development and continuous
integration, are virtually unknown in the game industry. Examples during
last night's discussion, which were held up as indicators of how
difficult and complex game dev is, appeared to many people in the room
to simply be symptoms of clearly bad design.</p>
<p>The legendary long hours and project burnout in the game industry is
actually a symptom of this - far from being the most capable engineers
amongst us, the reason they are working such ungodly hours is to
compensate for poor software engineering. The rest of the software
industry used to suffer from a similar overwork problem, but you know
what? We figured it out, decades ago now. It's notable to me that other
industries which suffer from overwork and burnout (eg. the finance
industry) are also buzzing with arrogance and secrecy.</p>
<p>Humility and communication are pre-requisites for any learning. Jeez,
get over yourselves and go learn how to run a software project.</p>

<p>Written by none other
than the OpenGL architecture review board themselves, this is the de
facto starting point for anyone learning how to write programs to draw
computer graphics using the OpenGL graphics API. As such, the entire
breadth of OpenGL is described in these 800 weighty pages.</p>
<p>This comes with one or two questionable implications. Firstly, the
authors, being the authoritative source, are obliged to cover the
entirety of the OpenGL interface, even though portions of it are now
obsolete, having been supplanted in practice by newer techniques. The
older methods are still present, and are described here on an equal
footing with the later additions.</p>
<p>Similarly, to avoid getting embroiled in the idiosyncrasies of any
particular vendor's implementation of OpenGL, there is never more than
an occasional vague allusion to the potential performance implications
of using one approach over another. The concept of using vertex arrays
is covered in a general-principles sort of way, as are vertex buffer
objects, with the admonition to "prefer them over explicit calls to
glVertex() for performance" buried in an appendix-like chapter near the
end. The idea that rendering primitives of GL_TRIANGLES is heavily
optimised on modern graphics cards receives no mention, from which I
mistakenly inferred that other primitive types such as
GL_TRIANGLE_STRIPs, with their lower apparent vertex counts, are a
preferable alternative.</p>
<p>This egalitarian presentation means that the book can rightly claim to
be an unbiased description of OpenGL the interface, and is lent a
long-term relevance by giving no bias towards any particular vendor, nor
being subject to the fashions of rendering techniques that sweep through
the industry every few years. On the other hand, it also means that the
book is considerably larger than most people learning OpenGL will need,
and fails to cover many of the vastly performance-enhancing techniques
that have become standard throughout the industry.</p>
<p>Rating: 6/10.</p>
<p>I bought the 'Orange' Shader Language book next. Can anyone recommend
one of the other OpenGL books that are out there? Since they are all 800
pages I'd rather not wade through them all to find the best one.</p>

<p><em>Director: Brian de Palma (1983)</em></p>
<p>Oh, I don't know, my expectations were too high or something. I expected
an intense study of greed, corruption and criminal will. Maybe I'm
desensitized. All I found was that it frequently descends into simply
camp 1970s gunfight scenes. Amusing to note the influences it has had on
other media, particularly the mansion in <em>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</em>.
I couldn't find much else to commend it.</p>

    <p><a href="http://jtauber.com/blog/">Unnofficial meme</a> from the <a href="http://www.planetpython.org">Unofficial Planet
Python</a>, programming languages you know or
have known:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>BASIC</strong> (ZX Spectrum, BBC and GFA) Thanks Mum and Dad for buying
    the old Speccy for me and my brother, and thanks also to WHSmiths
    for replacing about twenty of them free of charge, bricked by
    wobbling peripherals. Was slow, slow, slow. Be thankful those pixels
    were so big. The foray into BBC BASIC came for a single, albeit
    paying, project at the school where my Dad was headmaster. I also
    wrote a bunch of GFA BASIC on the Atari ST, which was relatively
    cool, as these things go. Did away with line numbers, had parameters
    passable by value or reference, and compiled to produce reasonably
    fast stand-alone executables. Lacking a compelling way to aggregate
    values into structures though.</li>
<li>
<strong>Z80 assembler</strong>, self taught on the ZX Spectrum. Wrestling with
    that darn screen's convoluted memory layout.</li>
<li>
<strong>68000 assembler</strong>, self taught on the Atari ST. Finally fast
    enough to do wonderful things to the screen, which had a reasonably
    sane memory representation. Wished I was doing it on an Amiga
    instead though.</li>
<li>
<strong>C</strong>, learned on-the-job at a student apprenticeship at Marconi R&amp;D
    during my university holidays. Special mention deserved for
    Kernighan and Ritchie <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language_(book)"><em>The C Programming
    Language</em></a>,
    as beautifully definitive and concise description of the language -
    just about every computer book employs a detracting surplus of
    verbiage in comparison.</li>
<li>
<strong>Modula-2</strong>, as part of the aforementioned apprenticeship. My first
    OO, I guess. Full of great ideas that I didn't fully appreciate at
    the time, having never worked on large enough projects to require
    them (or indeed, any project that wasn't a personal bedroom
    project.)</li>
<li>
<strong>Pascal</strong>, for a one-term 3D graphics project at university.</li>
<li>
<strong>C++</strong>, on the PC, self-taught using a mixture of pirated and
    cut-price academic Visual Studio licenses. Anyhow, this then lead to
    years and years of professional C++ development, mostly on various
    UNIX boxes, mostly in the GIS industry. So exhilarating when it
    worked, with the intricate, interlocking mechanisms whirling their
    fiendishly efficient blades through tasks like a light sabre through
    butter. But writing it, with hindsight, was *so* *much*
    *work*. And such an utter ball ache to find those intermittent
    bugs that would shake the whole thing explosively to pieces like a
    brick through a jet engine when you least expected it. I must have
    been a masochist.</li>
<li>
<strong>BASH</strong> shell scripts, still in daily use to this day, mostly tiny
    bits of script-fu to automate common desktop tasks, or pipe the
    output from one thing into some other thing, or heck, even to just
    do some sorting or filtering on part of the file you're editing in
    <em>Vi</em>. Absolutely indispensable to me, despite the fact that half the
    time I'm wrestling with the impedance mismatch of running it in
    Cygwin on Windows. I literally don't understand how developers can
    get along without using it *everywhere*.</li>
<li>
<strong>SQL</strong> and a bunch of stored procedures in <strong>PL-SQL</strong> (procedural
    SQL.)</li>
<li>
<strong>C#</strong>. Lots to like here, we spent a couple of very happy years
    together.</li>
<li>
<strong>Visual Basic 6</strong>, and then later some <strong>Visual Basic .NET</strong>. They
    made me do it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Python</strong>, including <strong>IronPython</strong> (Python as a dot Net language.)
    Nirvana at last. Apart from BASH, it's the only entry on the list
    that I still use daily today, and unlike BASH, the usage is gleeful.</li>
<li>
<strong>GLSL</strong>, for hobbyist graphics and games.</li>
<li>
<strong>Scheme</strong> to the extent that I worked through SICP, twice.</li>
<li>
<strong>Go</strong>, for a new service in IBM Cloud.</li>
<li>
<strong>PHP</strong>, to maintain an old service in IBM Cloud. Two PR's thus far.</li>
</ul>
<p>I find my lack of <strong>LISP</strong> and its derivatives disturbing. And last year
I recall entertaining fantasies of learning <strong>D</strong>, to see if I could use
it as a more civilised alternative to C-extensions for Python. And just
yesterday I was playing with a minimal OpenGL fragment and vertex
shaders, longing to be conversant with <strong>Cg</strong>. Yeah yeah, I'll figure
them all out later this week...</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: First time through I forgot all about SQL, PL-SQL and BASH.</p>

<p>I've always been
intrigued by <a href="http://openid.net">OpenID</a>, while simultaneously being
repulsed by the identifiers that I thought users were forced to adopt.
Seeing one too many strings like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>https://me.yahoo.com/a/.DuSz_IEq5Vw5NZLAHUFHWEKLSfQnRFuebro-</p>
</blockquote>
<p>tossed around made me think I'd have to adopt a username like that,
which obviously is never going to wash, for aesthetic and typability
reasons alone.</p>
<p>Fortunately <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200809/openid_is_too_hard.html">Ned Batchelder's
rant</a>,
leading me to <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2006/Dec/19/openid/">Simon 'Zeppelin' Willison's demystifying blog
post</a>, taught me all about
how to use your own URL as your OpenID equivalent of a username, by
inserting some HTML onto your web page. So now I've managed to jump
through the sign-up hoops required to get me one of those
globally-unique OpenID username identifiers for myself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tartley.com</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There. That isn't too painful, is it? Since I got set up, it has proven
lovely to use. Get on board!</p>

<p><em>by Clay Shirky (2008)</em></p>
<p>Shirky has thrown a few beautiful and insightful essays over the wall
the last few months. He is the guy who penned the '<a href="http://www.herecomeseverybody.org/2008/04/looking-for-the-mouse.html">Gin, Television and
Social
Surplus</a>'
piece a while back. It's a joy to find that this book is up to the same
standard.</p>
<p>In it, he explains how the social changes enabled by recent technology
are profoundly and permanently altering the ways in which human beings
interact, form groups, and get things done.</p>
<p>This is making activities and projects possible which could never have
been dreamed of even ten years ago, and is similarly displacing many
established institutions. The greatest effects of this change will be
seen when the technology has progressed to the point of invisibility,
and the current upheavals in the music and newspaper industries are just
the leading edge of the wave.</p>
<p>It's a change no less significant than the invention of the printing
press, in terms of its ability to transform societal institutions. We do
indeed live in interesting times.</p>
<p>Rating 10/10 - everyone should read it.</p>

are online, as is the <a href="http://tartley.com/files/stretching_pyglets_wings/stretching_pyglets_wings-1.3.zip">demo source
code</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update v1.1</strong>: Fixed a bug using batches of vertex lists. (they don't
work with triangle fans, and they need a duplicated first and last
vertex in each list to delineate primitives.) Rendering speed is still
awful using graphics.draw, vertex_lists and batches though. I'm chasing
that up next.</p>
<p><strong>Update v1.2:</strong> Fixed some of the performance problems, demo 6's
batches of vertex lists are now the fastest way to render, which is the
expected result. Still curious why calls to pyglet.graphics.draw() are
slower than pyglet.gl.glvertex() though.</p>
<p><strong>Update v1.3</strong>: Added demo 9 which creates a maze with ghosts wandering
within it. The entire maze is rendered in a single batch.draw() call.
Innumerable other improvements throughout.</p>

<p><em>by Ivan Idso</em>, 2007.</p>
<p>A disclaimer, to begin - the author is my new-to-me brother in law, so I
got a copy at cost, inscribed 'soft aardvarks' (I think), and a few
weeks later got a once-in-a-lifetime experience of being taken on a
balloon ride by the man himself. So the write-up is going to be a
glowing one.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I don't have to stretch the truth at all in order to do so.
It's a short and lightweight read, which does explain the mechanics and
practicalities of hot-air ballooning. However, the focus of the book is
on the social aspects, and the effect it has had on the life and
disposition of Ivan, his family and friends. As a result, it's a
thoroughly personal and heart-warming read, engrossing and explanatory
and fulfilling throughout, that left me feeling closer to the author,
and with more of an understanding of him and his lifestyle.</p>

<p><em>by Jerome D. Salinger (1951)</em></p>
<p>Of course, people make such a fuss over it, they really do. You ask
anyone. It's that Salinger's fault. He never listens to anyone.
Sometimes I think he only writes it because he knows it gets on peoples
goat. Writing about some crazy kid. I mean, I say he's crazy because
that's what everyone says, but he's no crazier than the rest of us if
you want to know the truth. Smoking and swearing getting laid, if he got
half a chance. But it's only what anyone would have done, well, anyone
with any sense, that is.</p>
<p>There's one thing about it though, it made me remember a time when I was
very young, no joke, and I started reading this very book, I don't know
where I got it, I think my Father gave it to me. But I don't think I got
very far. It must have been beyond me, to tell you the truth. Well,
you've got to give the old Pater his due, for trying to stretch you and
all that. That's just like him, it really is.</p>
<p>Anyway, the story doesn't really go anywhere, at least not anywhere I
could fathom. Well, things happen, but it's just everyday things over
the few days after being expelled from school. The usual stuff. You
could write a whole essay, I suppose, about whether or not Caulfield
changes or learns anything by the novel's end, or simply remains an
adolescent. But I don't think that would amount to very much. So it's a
stylistic experience, at any rate. Very '<em>A Portrait of the Artist as a
Young Man</em>' I'm sure, and you've got to give him his due.</p>
<p>Rating: 7/10 - Bloody Salinger, he never listens to anyone, him.</p>
