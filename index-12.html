<p>I've always been
intrigued by <a href="http://openid.net">OpenID</a>, while simultaneously being
repulsed by the identifiers that I thought users were forced to adopt.
Seeing one too many strings like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>https://me.yahoo.com/a/.DuSz_IEq5Vw5NZLAHUFHWEKLSfQnRFuebro-</p>
</blockquote>
<p>tossed around made me think I'd have to adopt a username like that,
which obviously is never going to wash, for aesthetic and typability
reasons alone.</p>
<p>Fortunately <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200809/openid_is_too_hard.html">Ned Batchelder's
rant</a>,
leading me to <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2006/Dec/19/openid/">Simon 'Zeppelin' Willison's demystifying blog
post</a>, taught me all about
how to use your own URL as your OpenID equivalent of a username, by
inserting some HTML onto your web page. So now I've managed to jump
through the sign-up hoops required to get me one of those
globally-unique OpenID username identifiers for myself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tartley.com</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There. That isn't too painful, is it? Since I got set up, it has proven
lovely to use. Get on board!</p>

<p><em>by Clay Shirky</em>, 2008.</p>
<p>Shirky has thrown a few beautiful and insightful essays over the wall
the last few months. He is the guy who penned the '<a href="http://www.herecomeseverybody.org/2008/04/looking-for-the-mouse.html">Gin, Television and
Social
Surplus</a>'
piece a while back. It's a joy to find that this book is up to the same
standard.</p>
<p>In it, he explains how the social changes enabled by recent technology
are profoundly and permanently altering the ways in which human beings
interact, form groups, and get things done.</p>
<p>This is making activities and projects possible which could never have
been dreamed of even ten years ago, and is similarly displacing many
established institutions. The greatest effects of this change will be
seen when the technology has progressed to the point of invisibility,
and the current upheavals in the music and newspaper industries are just
the leading edge of the wave.</p>
<p>It's a change no less significant than the invention of the printing
press, in terms of its ability to transform societal institutions. We do
indeed live in interesting times.</p>
<p>Rating 10/10 - everyone should read it.</p>

<p>I'm excited to be giving a talk at PyCon UK next weekend about creating
OpenGL programs in Python, using the graphics and games library
<a href="http://pyglet.org/">pyglet</a>. I'm still working feverishly on the
presentation. This post is to be a permanent URL for the content,
downloadable demos and YOUR comments, once PyCon is over.</p>
<p>See y'all there.</p>
<p><strong>Update v1.0</strong>: The <a href="http://tartley.com/files/stretching_pyglets_wings/presentation.zip">presentation
slides</a>
are online, as is the <a href="http://tartley.com/files/stretching_pyglets_wings/stretching_pyglets_wings-1.3.zip">demo source
code</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update v1.1</strong>: Fixed a bug using batches of vertex lists. (they don't
work with triangle fans, and they need a duplicated first and last
vertex in each list to delineate primitives.) Rendering speed is still
awful using graphics.draw, vertex_lists and batches though. I'm chasing
that up next.</p>
<p><strong>Update v1.2:</strong> Fixed some of the performance problems, demo 6's
batches of vertex lists are now the fastest way to render, which is the
expected result. Still curious why calls to pyglet.graphics.draw() are
slower than pyglet.gl.glvertex() though.</p>
<p><strong>Update v1.3</strong>: Added demo 9 which creates a maze with ghosts wandering
within it. The entire maze is rendered in a single batch.draw() call.
Innumerable other improvements throughout.</p>

<p><em>by Ivan Idso</em>, 2007.</p>
<p>A disclaimer, to begin - the author is my new-to-me brother in law, so I
got a copy at cost, inscribed 'soft aardvarks' (I think), and a few
weeks later got a once-in-a-lifetime experience of being taken on a
balloon ride by the man himself. So the write-up is going to be a
glowing one.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I don't have to stretch the truth at all in order to do so.
It's a short and lightweight read, which does explain the mechanics and
practicalities of hot-air ballooning. However, the focus of the book is
on the social aspects, and the effect it has had on the life and
disposition of Ivan, his family and friends. As a result, it's a
thoroughly personal and heart-warming read, engrossing and explanatory
and fulfilling throughout, that left me feeling closer to the author,
and with more of an understanding of him and his lifestyle.</p>

<p><em>by Jerome D. Salinger</em>, 1951.</p>
<p>Of course, people make such a fuss over it, they really do. You ask
anyone. It's that Salinger's fault. He never listens to anyone.
Sometimes I think he only writes it because he knows it gets on peoples
goat. Writing about some crazy kid. I mean, I say he's crazy because
that's what everyone says, but he's no crazier than the rest of us if
you want to know the truth. Smoking and swearing getting laid, if he got
half a chance. But it's only what anyone would have done, well, anyone
with any sense, that is.</p>
<p>There's one thing about it though, it made me remember a time when I was
very young, no joke, and I started reading this very book, I don't know
where I got it, I think my Father gave it to me. But I don't think I got
very far. It must have been beyond me, to tell you the truth. Well,
you've got to give the old Pater his due, for trying to stretch you and
all that. That's just like him, it really is.</p>
<p>Anyway, the story doesn't really go anywhere, at least not anywhere I
could fathom. Well, things happen, but it's just everyday things over
the few days after being expelled from school. The usual stuff. You
could write a whole essay, I suppose, about whether or not Caulfield
changes or learns anything by the novel's end, or simply remains an
adolescent. But I don't think that would amount to very much. So it's a
stylistic experience, at any rate. Very '<em>A Portrait of the Artist as a
Young Man</em>' I'm sure, and you've got to give him his due.</p>
<p>Rating: 7/10 - Bloody Salinger, he never listens to anyone, him.</p>

<p><em>by Kurt Vonnegut</em>, 1973.</p>
<p>I've always loved Vonnegut (who doesn't?) but I'd avoided this since
seeing the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120618/">painful 1999 movie</a>
made of it, proof if ever it were needed that some books are simply
unfilmable.</p>
<p>The novel, however, is everything we love about Vonnegut. His clarity,
wit, grumpiness and simplicity. The story of ordinary people in a small
midwestern town reads like a playful Hemmingway, but forms a therapeutic
rumination on the nature of sanity, and the author's own relationship
with it, in the insane world we find ourselves in.</p>
<p>Rating: 7/10 - and so on.</p>

<p><em>by Paul Graham, 2004.</em></p>
<p>I'd already stumbled across many of the <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">individual
essays</a> that this is comprised
of, but it was still hugely entertaining and educational to discover
some of Graham's essays that I hadn't read yet. He covers a wide variety
of topics, and inevitably for such a collection, the components vary in
quality, but generally they are extremely engaging. I only regret having
to grab them in dead-tree format since I lost my iPhone. Ohdeary.</p>

<p><em>by Charles Stross</em>, 2007.</p>
<p>It's a tale of corporate shenanigans, online virtual reality computer
gaming, scams, police on the beat, software contractors, and political
intrigue, set in the midst of a near-future Scotland. It's told in first
person, by a rotating set of a half-dozen characters, which I found
distracting.</p>
<p>The Scottish vernacular and the boozed-up Brit attitudes in a mildly
science-fictional setting come across as parochial rather than grungy,
and projected technologies such as self-driving cars and virtual
realities all seem too intrusive and out of place.</p>
<p>The premise oscillates between nauseating and preposterous, as an
in-game robbery of virtual items gradually tips off its investigators
that someone, somewhere, has got their hands on some heavy-duty
decryption keys with which far more sinister acts are being perpetrated.
Before it's done, there is a scene where the software engineer caught in
the middle of it all has to play a swords-and-sorcery online computer
game, upon the outcome of which hangs the safety of the free world. Oh
deary.</p>
<p>I really, really, <em>really</em>, loved Stross' <em>Accelerando</em>, so maybe my
expectations were just set too high. Can this really be from the same
author, and written a scant 12 months afterwards?</p>
<p>Rating: 3/10. Letdown.</p>

<p><em>by David Leavitt</em>, 2006.</p>
<p>An impulse buy, and it was good but not great. The barbaric treatment
Turing received over being gay seems to be the thing that initially
attracted the author's interest in Turing's life, and while that is a
worthwhile and thought-provoking topic, it is a little over-played here.
While Turing's mathematical contributions are covered quite commendably,
I'd pretty much read all of it before, and it somehow seemed to be
lacking a tiny sparkle of passion that made me suspect the author had
done his absolute damnedest to cover the mathematical side of Turing,
because no book about him would be complete without it, but without
really ever wanting to.</p>
<p>Rating: 5/10. Solid but not much that is new.</p>
