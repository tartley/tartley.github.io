    <p>Ken Arnold posted about the <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/arnold/archive/2005/06/generics_consid_1.html">problems with
generics</a>,
namely that they substantially increase code complexity without
providing commensurate benefits.</p>
<p>He's spot on - generics are the programming language feature that never
should have happened, and I speak as someone who, when I was a heavy
user of C++, <em>loved</em> generics. Even now I yearn for the elegant
consistency of the Standard Template Library. But the points Ken makes
from a Java perspective apply equally well to C++, and C# as well. That
generics increase both the semantic and syntactic complexity of code is
undeniable. Their benefit as a runtime type-checking mechanism <em>does</em>
prevent - or at least help diagnose - certain classes of bug. But these
bugs are not generally especially common, nor difficult to diagnose or
fix in the first place. This can be seen quite clearly when considering
that dynamic languages, which enforce no type checking at all, do not
suffer in development effort nor code maintainability as a result - if
anything, they demonstrate the converse.</p>
<p>One benefit that Ken doesn't mention is the use of generics to signal a
programmer's intent - to make a collection homogeneous is, to a limited
extent, to make it self-documenting. Again though, this benefit is small
compared to the complexity costs.</p>
<p>When I started typing I thought I had more of a point. Ho hum.</p>

    <p>I loved a <a href="http://geothought.blogspot.com/2007/06/thoughts-on-ges-next-generation-system.html">recent
post</a>
by GIS luminary Peter Batty about forthcoming developments in the GIS
industry. However, I was struck by his allusions to a future release of
Smallworld which would dispense of the problems caused by the common
practice of individual clients writing custom software to tailor the
system to their specific needs, by allowing sufficient data-driven
customisation out of the box. I wrote a response which I think I'm going
to post here as well. Suck it up.</p>
<p>My interest and excitement was tinged with a frisson of trepidation, at
the description of the configurable GIS behaviour. I know there's a
whole phalanx of very smart engineers at GE, who are no doubt
immeasurably more cognisant of the following issues than myself. But, as
is my wont, I'm not going to let that get in the way of an opportunity
for a jolly good rant, so here goes.</p>
<p>Obviously data driven behaviour is brilliant. However, it's only good up
to a point. Once the behaviour in question becomes complex enough (and a
GIS definitely qualifies), there's a real risk of the <a href="http://worsethanfailure.com/Articles/The_Inner-Platform_Effect.aspx">Inner Platform
effect</a>:
In an effort to achieve the same levels of flexibility as the
programming languages that it is designed to replace, the configuration
system ends up replicating all their features - badly.</p>
<p>Such an endeavour is caught between two stools. If it is insufficiently
ambitious, the configuration will not be flexible enough to meet
clients' needs. If it does manages to capture the power of the
programming languages it replaces, then it is Turing complete, and all
you have done is convert customisation using a standard, proven,
well-known programming language into configuration using a ghastly
proprietary language that is embedded within your configuration schema.</p>
<p>In addition, creating such a configuration actually ends up being much
harder for clients. It requires deep proprietary skills, as opposed to
common skills like C#, and it cannot lean on any of the supportive
ecosystem of tools and knowledge that an established language has built
up over the years. Perhaps worst of all, it will *still* require
software engineering skills to perform the configuration, and all the
good software engineers will have run a mile.</p>
<p>Like I say, no doubt there are smart people at GE who have been figuring
out solutions to all this for years by now, but I'd have to hear what
those solutions were before I'd trust such a system.</p>
<p>To my way of thinking, the best solution to the problem is to
acknowledge that the best way of specifying behaviour is to use a
programming language - that is exactly what they were designed for.
Trying to sidestep that is simply swimming against the current, and you
need to embrace it. You want a domain specific language (DSL), so that
it is concise and intuitive for clients, but you don't want it to be a
proprietary language - that way lies madness. So what you need is to
provide is a library that extends an existing, established language,
making it into your GIS DSL. Creating DSLs from Python or Ruby is all
the rage these days, and I believe the above chain of reasoning is why.</p>

<p><em>by Procedural Arts (PC, 2006)</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.interactivestory.net/">http://www.interactivestory.net/</a></p>
<p><em>Façade</em> is an art and research project which aims to extend the remit
of gaming, making a bold raid deep into rarely-explored territory. It
opens with a voicemail, inviting you to visit old friends, and then
presents the player with a first-person view from outside your caller's
apartment door.</p>
<p><span style="background:#bb2200; color:white; border-radius: 1em; padding-left: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em; padding-top: 2px;"><b>spoilers</b></span></p>
<p>Stepping up briskly, I was just getting to grips with
the mouse cursor's context-sensitive prompt to knock on the door, when I
began to discern the muffled but unmistakable sounds of an argument
going on inside. The familiar sinking feeling invoked as you screw up
your courage, overcome your hesitation, and knock regardless, is
possibly a gaming first.</p>
<p>Awkward social situations are nothing new in other media, but the
<em>complicity</em> engendered by interactivity and first-person immersion
enhances the effect. It's a rich vein, and the ensuing interactive drama
mines it deeply - starting with the knock, upon which a voice fiercely
whispers "He's here <em>already</em>? I thought you said 8 o'clock?"</p>
<p>Your hosts Trip and Grace do their best to welcome you gracefully, but
there's clearly tension in the air. You can speak to them at any point
just by typing on the keyboard, and navigate the apartment, or mess with
its fixtures, using the mouse. The story that unfolds is highly
dependant on your behaviour, as Trip and Grace respond to you and to
each other, using a social AI system developed specifically for this
project. Consequentially, the storyline and its outcome varies massively
from one replay to the next - although similar themes are often brought
out somewhere along the way: the Italian holiday that no-one wants to
talk about; the 'experimental' decor - a symptom of Grace's frustration
with her uncreative graphic design job.</p>
<p>There are no goals, no score. No explicit measures of success. Judging
by my few replays, the evening can end in one of a small number of ways,
some of them are sad or embarrassing, others, perhaps the more elusive
ones, are happy or hopeful. If the player chooses to adopt the
attainment of a particular story-ending as a self-assigned goal, then
that's up to them - and surely that's the very essence of what
interactivity is all about.</p>
<p><em>Façade</em> isn't without its flaws. The graphics are perfunctory - which
is arguably a positive, since it's Southpark visual style steers well
clear of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">the Valley</a>, but
will doubtless repel the superficiality of the mainstream. Similarly,
the AI has a limited repertoire - it only knows how to converse around
particular topics, using the words and phrases that have been recorded
by voice actors. Again though, this has an upside, as the confines of
the two-room apartment, its three occupants, and the prominence of their
relationship problems all serve to reinforce the intensity of the
situation. More pertinently though, even within these constraints the AI
isn't perfect - this is a research project after all. The inevitable
failure to recognise your typed input is often handled relatively
gracefully, by a confused look from Trip or Grace, or an abrupt subject
change, passed off as a deliberate avoidance of the topic you were
broaching - a tactic that sometimes actually becomes more effective and
engaging the more insistent your attempts become.</p>
<p>It's often-cited in the game development world that the industry is
still not mature enough to know how to write a game that can make the
player cry. The current state-of-the art is comparable to the crude
motion-pictures of the late 19th century. Who would have believed,
watching the grainy, silent flickering of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Ott%27s_Sneeze">Fred Ott's
Sneeze</a>, the narrative
and emotional finesse to which that medium would one day soar? For all
its faults, it's in increments such as <em>Façade</em> that gaming moves in the
same direction.</p>
<p>Rating: 9/10.

<p>I've always preferred the open standards and cross-platform philosophy
of OpenGL over DirectX. In recent years though, development of OpenGL
has seemed to stall somewhat, while DirectX has continually put out new
iterations that seem to significantly enhance functionality while
improving useability. We use a lot of IronPython at
<a href="http://resolversystems.com/">Resolver</a>, the dotNET dialect of Python,
so the last couple of nights I thought I'd throw my principles and good
taste to the wind, and work through the IronPython samples to see how
well it works with the .Net interface of DirectX. The verdict: It works
just fine. Albeit with colossal dependancies, for something that simply
thows a dozen vertices around the screen. And only on one operating
system. Gah.</p>

<p><em>by Melvyn Bragg (2006)</em></p>
<p>A brilliant assembly of potted snippets of history, ideal for someone
like myself with scarcely a glimmer of an education. By cunning omission
of the definite article, Bragg gets to talk not just about 12 important
books, but is able to manipulate the list such that it is all about 12
<em>British</em> books, a move I heartily approve of. Apparently written to
accompany some television series, I neither knew nor cared. For the
record, his selection is below:</p>
<p><br style="clear: both"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Principia Mathematica</em> by Isaac Newton, 1687. "Will always have a
    pre-eminance above all the other works of human genius."</li>
<li>
<em>Married Love</em> by Marie Stopes, 1918. Transformed the married lives
    of a whole generation, furthering the rights of women, and making it
    possible to broach subjects that had been entirely taboo.</li>
<li>
<em>Magna Carta</em> by Members of the English ruling classes, 1215. The
    fundamental origins of the English constitution, setting up a
    balance of powers which forms the basis and language for many others
    since, including America and India.</li>
<li>
<em>The Rule Book of Association Football</em> by a group of former English
    public school men. Codifying the most popular game on the planet.</li>
<li>
<em>On the Origin of Species</em> by Charles Darwin, 1859. The greatest and
    most far-reaching scientific theory yet produced.</li>
<li>
<em>On the Abolition of the Slave Trade</em> an oration by William
    Wilberforce in Parliament, 1789. This was published immediately
    after his oration in parliament, forming a cornerstone of the
    anti-slave trade movement, and eventually leading to the abolition
    of the slave trade just days before Wilberforce's death, a move
    that, in subsequent decades, was emulated by nations all over the
    world.</li>
<li>
<em>A Vindication of the Rights of Women</em> by Mary
    Wollsenstonecraft, 1792. The first great feminine thesis, coming at
    a time when the world sorely needed it.</li>
<li>
<em>Experimental Researches in Electricity</em> by Michael Faraday,
    1839-55. A study in dedication and impartial perseverance, resulting
    in an astonishing number of discoveries which now affect the
    everyday lives of billions.</li>
<li>
<em>Patent Specification for Arkwright's Spinning Machine</em> by Richard
    Arkwright, 1769. Trailblazer for a commerce-fuelled industrial
    revolution that shows no signs of slowing down in its transformation
    of the world.</li>
<li>
<em>The King James Bible</em> by fifty-four scholars appointed by the
    King, 1611. A beautiful construction that has contributed more
    phrases and expressions to the English language than any other
    source.</li>
<li>
<em>An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations</em> by

<p>Daniel's usual brand of heartfelt, bittersweet, dorky, whimsically
playful stand-up, in the delightful environs of Regent's Park Open Air
Theatre, with the Junior Penns &amp; co, and Hallie visiting from Minnesota.
More cynical souls were untouched, but Hallie and I loved it.</p>

    <p>It's been said before by others, but I hadn't realised how insidious it
is: When musicians talk about 'theory', they actually mean 'notation'.
With reference to my <a href="http://tartley.com/?p=100">previous whinging</a>
about music notation, I notice that the <a href="http://www.mnma.org/">Music Notation Modernization
Association</a> are suggesting a number of revisions
to make notation more useful and consistent. One of the more prominent
suggestions is a change to the use of staves to make them compatible
with the octave-offset principle I mentioned earlier, thus making the
appearance of notes consistent across all staves, and making the use of
clefs of any kind redundant.</p>
<p>The above idea especially comes into its own when combined with their
other proposals:</p>
<p><em>Chromatic staves</em> to indicate intervals in a proportional manner
(rather than the current bonkers '♯' and '♭' notation)</p>
<p><img alt="chromatic-intervals.gif" src="files/2007/06/chromatic-intervals.gif"></p>
<p><em>Twinline</em> staves, which only require two horizontal lines, rather
than the conventional five, provides a significant increase in
readability, in keeping with Tufte's principle of
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142/">maximising data-ink ratio</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="twinline.gif" src="files/2007/06/twinline.gif"></p>
<p><em>Note color</em> or shape used to discriminate pitch, rather than the
current quirky use of partially indicating note length. This is
perhaps my favourite, as it massively increases the ease of rapidly
identifying notes on sight. Since note colour is currently used to
distinguish between a minim and a crotchet, then some other way of
making them distinct would have to be found. A unique flag on the
note stem would seem to suffice, and would be more in keeping with
the other note duration symbology.</p>
<p><img alt="note-color.gif" src="files/2007/06/note-color.gif"></p>
<p>After what looks like years of painstaking brainstorming, research,
focus testing and refinement, the only thing left for the MNMA to do is
to decide on one single notation that unambiguously combines all the
above ideas, and promote its use with the aim of gradually supplanting
conventional notation. Unfortunately, this seems to be something they
have singularly failed to do. By failing to adopt and recommend a single
notation, they seem to be ensuring that none of their ideas will ever
gain any traction.</p>
