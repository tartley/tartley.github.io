<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I’m an experienced back-end developer, mostly using Python, who
really cares about programming. For you, this means that I create
products that work reliably, and are less expensive to maintain and
extend in the future. Deliveries are incremental and frequent, to make
progress legible to all.</p>
<p>Good teams are a pre-requisite, which means continuous mentoring,
pairing, jovial relationships, real talk, and pride in our mutually
raised expectations of one another.</p>
<h2 id="experience-and-technologies">Experience and technologies</h2>
<p>I have 15 years experience in <strong>Python</strong> (and have used
Go, C, C#, C++). I created <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama">Colorama</a>, the world’s
<a href="https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/#colorama">28th most
popular</a> Python library. This summer, I was an instructor in Stanford
University’s <a href="https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/#:~:text=Learn%20content">Code in
Place 2025</a>, and in the past I was tech reviewer on O’Reilly’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Python-Selenium-JavaScript-dp-1098148711/dp/1098148711">Test
Driven Development with Python</a>. I’ve presented at multiple PyCons
and am a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation.</p>
<p>I consult and mentor in <strong>Test-Driven Development
(TDD)</strong>, and my favorite roles have used this intensively, where
it aligns with the team, along with other <strong>Agile</strong> and
<strong>eXtreme Programming</strong> techniques such as
<strong>pairing</strong> and <strong>trunk-based
development</strong>.</p>

<em>Sep 2023</em> to<br />

<td style="text-align: left;">Lambda’s public cloud provides premier
GPUs for customers to train AI models. My team converts events like
customer GUI or HTTP API requests into hypervisor configuration changes
across many data centers, including defining GPUs, storage, &amp;
networks, presenting the resulting VMs to users as their own private
cluster. There I created our first on-hypervisor agent, which I deployed
to the bare metal fleet by trailblazing as “first customer” for our
nascent in-house ArgoCD setup (declarative gitops for k8s). I then
migrated functionality, starting with server health checks, from a
central command-and-control service, to the agent. This eliminated a
previous anti-pattern of micro-managing many hypervisors from afar with
low-level commands over ssh, making the code simpler, more performant,
and eliminating classes of errors &amp; races, thus improving user
experience and reducing on-call burden. (<strong>Python</strong>,
<strong>FastAPI</strong>, <strong>Pydantic</strong>,
<strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, a little <strong>Go</strong> and
<strong>Typescript/Vue</strong>)</td>

One time I consolidated code from the company’s various other binary
downloadable artifacts to all be handled by the Snap Store, converting
it into a generic “binary artifact store”, decommissioning other teams’
services as their functionality was subsumed, while preserving
compatibility with diverse public APIs for each artifact type, and
honoring high-traffic SLAs.</td>

<strong>Oracle</strong> databases, to implement dynamic on-instance
firewalling by converting user requests into <strong>iptables</strong>
config across many instances. I also produced &amp; presented my own
training course several times, ultimately across the whole division,
teaching hundreds of developers how to contribute <em>good</em> tests to
the massive IBM Cloud <strong>Python test suite</strong>, dramatically
reducing time spent on creating and maintaining tests, while making the
tests themselves orders of magnitude faster, more thorough, and more
reliable.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Often as a tech lead, such as at
<em>Able.ag</em>, where I relieved the company’s technical founder of
architectural, design, and mentoring responsibilities. Usually these
roles created <strong>web APIs</strong> in <strong>Python</strong>,
ingesting, transforming and <strong>ElasticSearch</strong> indexing
large amounts of <strong>data</strong>. At e-commerce startup
<em>Rangespan</em>, we integrated with hundreds of suppliers, to ingest
data to <strong>MySQL</strong> for 100 million product lines, and then
routed over a billion sales from participating retailers to dynamically
selected suppliers. At furniture retailer <em>made.com</em>, I was hired
to <strong>fix a dysfunctional team</strong>, which was moribund from
years of technical debt. I <strong>mentored</strong> individual team
members, hired some new ones, replaced the week-long manual deploy
process with modern <strong>CI/CD</strong>. Together we then radically
overhauled the processes and codebase, allowing the team to restart
predictable deliveries of business-critical features to production.</td>

British Cartographic Society’s award for the year. For <em>Ordinance
Survey</em> I designed <strong>spatial SQL</strong> queries to run
against MasterMap in <strong>Oracle</strong>, the UK’s definitive
multi-terabyte geographic dataset. <em>ESRI UK</em> asked me to create
an AutoCAD to ArcMap importer in <strong>C#</strong>, improving over
their existing one by correctly handling nested geometries such as
