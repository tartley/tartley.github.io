<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I’m an experienced software developer, a back-end generalist, specializing in Python.</p>
<p>I really care about programming. For you, this means that I create products that work and are well tested. Deliveries are incremental and frequent, to make progress visible, and less money is required to maintain and extend them in the future.</p>
<p>Good teams are a pre-requisite for this, which means continuous mentoring, jovial relationships, real talk, and pride in our mutually raised expectations.</p>
<h2 id="experience-and-technologies">Experience and technologies</h2>
<p>I have 15 years experience in <strong>Python</strong> (and other languages as required). I created <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama">Colorama</a>, a personal <strong>open source</strong> project that has become the world’s <a href="https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/#colorama">28th most popular</a> Python library. I present at international conferences like PyCon, and am a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation.</p>
<p>I work on <strong>Linux</strong>, often producing <strong>web APIs</strong>, leaning on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">HATEOAS</a>, using <strong>Django</strong>, <strong>FastAPI</strong>, or <strong>Flask</strong>, often interfacing with relational storage such as <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, Oracle or MySQL, or noSQL such as Rethink or MongoDB, indexed using Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>I consult and mentor in <strong>Test-Driven Development (TDD)</strong>, and regard projects which use this, and other <strong>Agile</strong> and <strong>eXtreme Programming</strong> techniques, as my favorites of the places I’ve worked. I was tech reviewer on O’Reilly’s <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/test-driven-development-with/9781491958698">Test Driven Development with Python</a>, published on testing <a href="https://www.tartley.com/posts/acceptance-testing-net-applications-using-ironpython">in Python Magazine</a>, and landed modest CPython patches <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/1341bb0019868345bab8adff94263c81e1d66eae#diff-d1243956feb505c5459fc05387e194609efb5c350cee202942be47ed30d7d7d0R354">in unittest</a>.</p>

<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Lambda</strong><br />
<em>1 year,</em><br />
<em>to present.</em></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lambda’s public cloud provides access to premier GPUs, which customers use to train AI models. My team converts customer requests and other events into configuration changes on hypervisors across multiple datacenters, to create and manage virtual machines, dynamic network configuration, access to GPU hardware and storage, presenting the results to users as their own private cluster. I analyze &amp; deliver new features such as our first on-hypervisor agent, to which I migrated our server health checks. Moving features like this out of our centralized command-and-control service allows the code to be simpler, more scalable and more responsive. Having direct access to the hypervisor like this is much more reliable than micro-managing many hypervisors from afar by sending low-level commands over ssh, eliminating whole classes of on-call issues. The team then helped me migrate our primary and most involved workflow, launching VMs.</td>

<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;"></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">To support the company’s side-hustle of building High Performance Computing clusters for clients, I produced a parameterizable Python model of proposed clusters, including server hardware, switches, and the routing of the thousands of networking connections between them, exporting the resulting model as detailed diagrams, bills of material, etc. This allowed Pre-Sales Engineering to present prospective clients with these details, along with quotes, on-demand, rather than after weeks, as is industry standard. This contributed to our smaller start-up winning multiple hundred-million dollar contracts over dominant competitors.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Canonical</strong><br />
<em>4 years</em><br />
</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The <a href="https://snapcraft.io/store"><em>Snap Store</em></a> is an app store for Linux applications. I worked as IC on the backend Python web APIs, which serve 5k req/s, providing downloads to securely update hundreds of millions of Linux devices. One effort that I lead consolidated code from the company’s other types of binary downloadable artifacts to all be handled by the Snap Store, turning many separate services into a single “binary artifact store”, which allowed us to decommission other teams’ services as their functionality was subsumed, and converge behaviors such as publishing, versioned updates, risk tracks, etc, to be more consistent across artifact types, all while honoring high-traffic SLAs &amp; preserving compatibility with public APIs used by the diverse clients of each artifact type.</td>

<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>IBM Cloud</strong><br />
<em>2 years</em></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Implemented IBM Cloud’s <a href="https://www.tartley.com/posts/illustrating-uses-of-ibm-cloud-security-groups/"><em>security groups</em></a> feature, in Python &amp; GoLang, converting user requests into iptables config across many instances, to provide dynamic on-instance firewalling. I also produced &amp; presented training courses across the division, teaching hundreds of developers how to contribute <em>good</em> tests to the massive IBM Cloud Python test suite, dramatically reducing time spent on creating and maintaining tests, while making the tests themselves orders of magnitude faster, and being more thorough and more reliable.</td>

<strong>Antidote.me,</strong><br />
<strong>BATS Trading,</strong><br />
<strong>Rangespan</strong><br />
<em>Contracts,</em><br />
<em>6 years.</em></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Often as a tech lead, such as at <strong>Able.ag</strong>, where I relieved the company’s technical founder of architectural, design, and mentoring responsibilities. Usually these roles created web APIs in Python, ingesting, transforming and indexing large amounts of data. At e-commerce startup <strong>Rangespan</strong>, we integrated with hundreds of suppliers to ingest data for 100 million product lines, and then routed over a billion sales from participating retailers to dynamically selected suppliers.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Made.com</strong><br />
<em>14 month</em><br />
<em>contract.</em></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">This furniture retailer’s backend Enterprise Resource Planning team was dysfunctional, moribund from years of technical debt. I mentored the team, hired new members, replaced the existing week-long manual deployment process with modern CI/CD. Together we radically fixed and improved the legacy systems, allowing the team to start delivering new business-critical features to production on a predictable schedule.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Resolver</strong><br />
<strong>Systems</strong><br />
<em>5 years.</em></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Hardcore eXtreme Programming startup, doing pairing and TDD, producing Python and .Net applications for financial and scientific clients. At one point I helped re-implement all of Excel’s statistical functions, with modern twists such as improved numerical accuracy.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>GIS</strong><br />
<strong>consulting</strong><br />
<em>3 years.</em></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">I single-handedly designed and coded <em>Habitat Capture</em>, a desktop GIS tool in .Net using ArcObjects. End users described it as “<em>about a billion times better</em>” than their last commissioned tool. The dataset they produced with my tool ended up winning that year’s British Cartographic Society award.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">For <strong>Ordinance Survey</strong> and <strong>ESRI UK</strong> I designed spatial SQL queries to run against the UK’s definitive multi-terabyte geographic dataset, as a proof-of-concept to derive new sellable data products.</td>
