A website dedicated to oneself has been described as the greatest act of hubris. Welcome aboard!

Made out of meat.

Class III sentience. Singular biological manifestation. Mortal. Human. He/him.

Computer programming sparks joy. Linux lover. Test obsessed. After a decade of
prickly devotion to static typed languages like C++, I flipped in the way that
only a true believer can, and these days I mostly wrangle Python.

Loving the [discussions](https://damiengwalter.com/podcast/) of science fiction
as *symbolic* fiction, which, at its best, combines the ancient, modern, and
postmodern worldviews. From the modern it takes rationality and prosperity,
while rejecting systemic exploitation and shallowness. From postmodernism it
takes healthy skepticism and independence of thought, while rejecting its
smothering nihilism. From the ancient, it takes the derivation of deep personal
and social meaning, while rejecting hierarchical cruelty and injustice. These
traits are synthesized into *metamodernism*, a worldview which addresses the
failings of modern life without the fascist abandonment of Enlightenment values,
generating stories which heal the culture wars by providing visions of a future
we can *all* get behind. One example of this is the genre of solarpunk - a
spunky, anarchist, optimistic view of the future.

Fight the fash, smash the patriarchy, support all identities, never fail to be
kind.
