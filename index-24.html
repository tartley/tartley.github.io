<p><em>by Jason Shiga (2016)</em></p>
<p>I'm just discovering the works of <a href="http://www.shigabooks.com">Jason Shiga</a>,
creator of mathematically-inspired nonlinear comic-books, e.g. stories drawn
on complex origami structures, that can be folded in various ways to represent
either branching story-lines, or else to manage state such as 'inventory'.
Construction of these more elaborate paper constructions doesn't scale,
(ie. I'm not likely to ever own one) but you can try some of his other
creations on the web.</p>
<p>This is <a href="http://www.shigabooks.com/index.php?page=001">Demon</a>,
a regular linear web-comic.</p>
<p>The storyline is 'math-inspired' too, in the same way that the movie <em>Primer</em>
is - intense, absolute, ruthless, narrative exploration of logical
implications, while continually, dizzyingly, escalating to the next level.</p>

<p>Another fabulously enjoyable science fiction adventure from qntm. Like their
other novels, it does a tremendous job of exploring the implications and
consequences of big science fiction concepts.</p>
<p>In this case, it's a story of human superheroes, whose powers derive from
beings-beyond-comprehension, from the high-dimensional multiverse, the
Structure, within which our paltry three-plus-one space-time is naught but an
embedded decal. Their struggles rewrite the fundamental physics of our
universe, to fashion it into an inescapable trap, denying humanity access to
advanced sciences, and to communion with the higher levels of the Structure.
Loved it.</p>
<p>For those like me with an epub fetish, you can buy <em>Fine Structure</em> in many
formats, including Amazon links, EPUBs, or free-to-read online, <a href="https://qntm.org/structure">at the

<p><em>by qntm, 2021</em>.</p>
<p>It took me a few pages to shift gears to match the provocatively casual style,
but once I did, it quickly became an engrossing and endearing read.
The book collects a series of tiny but grand adventures, each riffing on one
of the titular Ed's fabulous new inventions or discoveries. Together these
form an arc which burns through combinations of high-concept SF ideas at an
unseemly rate.</p>
<p>It reminded me of what I've fondly said about 200AD (the galaxy's greatest
comic), that somehow the superficiality of the medium allows
writers to experiment more wildly with form and content, throwing up a torrent
of creativity which, while sometimes uneven, generates moments of sheer
brilliance. I thought being a comic was an essential part of that formula. But
<em>Ed</em> proves me wrong by achieving the same velocity of verve and vigor,
rendered in prose. A delight.</p>
<p>The Epilogue reminds me gleefully of
<a href="https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/a/151964/13496">this Stack Overflow World-building answer</a>
I gave a few months ago.</p>

<p>I bought all four of <a href="https://qntm.org/fiction">qntm's books</a>
when I discovered the fantastic
<a href="posts/there-is-no-antimemetics-division/">There is no Antimemetics Division</a>.
I didn't really expect to like all of them, sight unseen, but was delighted to
support an emerging author who had contributed to the genius of SCP. But then
the books that arrived turned out to be bloody brilliant.</p>
<p>This one tells a tale in which magic was discovered to be real in the 1970s,
becoming a new, arcane branch of physics. From there, it piles on the twists
and raises the stakes at an enthralling and dizzying rate, demanding the
reader to keep up through many exciting layered reveals and escalating changes
of perspective. Absolutely smashing.</p>
<p>Like <em>Antimemetics</em>, it scores points with me for including some female heroes,
who surmount challenges through some striking strengths of character &amp;
expertise, rather than simply being the best at applied violence.</p>

<ul>
<li>I got most crypto energy use from
  <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/05/21098323/elon-musk-says-tesla-looking-at-other-cryptos-who-use-less-than-1-of-bitcoins-energy-which">this roundup</a>.</li>
<li>For Visa, I used the figures from <a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption">this breakdown</a>,
  and <a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption">this one</a>, which agrees.</li>
<li>For Bitcoin, I took a rounded figure roughly between those quoted on the
  above two sources (710kWh and 1,123kWh). A single figure precision is
  probably most appropriate anyhow. <strong>Update</strong>: The digiconomist article above
  is updated as the Bitcoin energy use increases over time with proof
  difficulty, and it's now at almost double the figure I quoted above,
  at 1,800 kWh/txn.</li>
<li>For Chia, I did my own hacky calculation.
  <a href="https://chiapower.org/">Chia Power estimates 6MW</a>
  in total is used by the Chia network, at current size of 4EiB.
  Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/transaction-volume">Chia Explorer shows a hard-to-read graph</a>
  which I'm eyeballing to get a rough average of 3,000 transactions per hour.
  6 Megawatts divided by 3k per hour gives an energy use per transaction
  of 2kW.</li>
<li>For Nano, I'm using commonly-cited figures in
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/7ucw1a/the_entire_nano_network_is_so_efficient_that/">Reddit posts</a>
  (yuk), but the math seems to hold up as far as I can see.</li>
<li>For equivalent household energy uses, I used
  <a href="https://electricityplans.com/kwh-kilowatt-hour-can-power/">this</a> and <a href="http://www.wrecc.com/what-uses-watts-in-your-home/">this</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notable standout here is NANO, which actually has an order of magnitude <em>lower</em>
energy use than Visa. There are other low-energy use cryptocurrencies in this
bracket, such as IOTA and HBAR. They face some criticism from Bitcoin
maximalists that reducing energy use undermines the value proposition, or
reduces security. But to my layman's ears, these arguments don't hold water.
Certainly communities like NANO seem much more open to honest discussion of
NANO's shortfalls than most crypto communities, which is a healthy sign, and it
makes me inclined to trust their counter-assertions that NANO's security is
really OK.</p>
<p>Something's not quite right here though. The Chia whitepaper estimates 10,000
times better energy efficiency than Bitcoin, by my figures above only show
1,000.</p>
<p>They probably know how to calculate this better than I do. So perhaps my figure
for Chia is high? I understand the value per transaction will come down as
Chia starts handling more transactions, which seems reasonable. Perhaps the
white paper refers to that future hypothetical efficiency?</p>
<p>On the other hand, many of the other cryptocurrencies listed above will
become more efficient in the future too (e.g. Bitcoin is in the process
of deploying its lightning network, which will reduce per transaction
energy use.)  So I think it's fair to leave the above figures as they are,
as a snapshot of current reality.</p>

    <p>Install ffmpeg:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">sudo apt install ffmpeg

<p>Install <code>youtube-dl</code>, a tool to download YouTube videos. Using <code>apt</code> installs a
version that's too old to work, so:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">pip install --user pipsi
pipsi install youtube-dl
</pre></div>

<h3>The best way</h3>
<p>Tell youtube-dl to download the audio:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">youtube-dl -x --audio-format<span class="o">=</span>best URL
</pre></div>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>-x</code> downloads just the audio part.</li>
<li>Audio format defaults to 'best', but can be "aac", "flac", "mp3", "m4a",
  "opus", "vorbis", or "wav".</li>
<li>URL is an encoded version of the video URL (youtu.be/XXX), obtained by
  hitting the 'share' button on the youtube page.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I understand it, it downloads whatever audio format YouTube provides,
then converts it locally using ffmpeg, so you're not really getting the
benefit of those lossless formats - mp3 is fine for
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSJWvzLuGz8">my</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyU1Pt2IXyE">needs</a>.</p>
<h3>My previous inferior way</h3>
<p>This method is worse because it downloads the whole video file before
extracting audio locally, and the download gets throttled by YouTube in some
way, which of late is very slow indeed.</p>
<p>Download the video from YouTube:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">youtube-dl URL
</pre></div>

<p>This results in a webm file. I have no idea what that is, and am relieved
to discover that converting it into an mp3 requires just:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ffmpeg -i MyVideoFile -vn MyAudioFile.mp3
</pre></div>

<p>Where <code>-vn</code> disables video in the output.</p>

<p><em>by Steven King, 2011</em></p>
<p>Prompted by a conversation at work about favorite time travel stories,
I snagged this from the library.</p>
<p>English school teacher Jake is roped into a dying man's plot to exploit a
mechanism of travelling back to 1958, from which, with many complications, he
waits out the intervening few years in order to prevent JFK's assassination.</p>
<p>I found it a page turner, certainly. But nonetheless I was slightly
disappointed, perhaps because of my reverence for such a successful author, who
I haven't actually read since my teens. Expectations of mastery clashed with
what, for me, felt like lowest-common-denominator style.</p>
<p>King knows exactly what he intends - to use time travel as a hook on which to
hang a human tale of drama, aspiration and loss. He has no interest in my
personal predilections, such as messing with the logical conundrums of his
chosen time-travel mechanic, and he declares this straightforwardly. When the
main character asks "But what if I end up killing my own Grandfather?", his
mentor shoots him a look of incomprehension, replying "Why in hell would you
want to do a thing like that?" Subject closed, and fair enough.</p>

the years since I last looked over their peerless and endlessly enthralling
wiki of dry and tantalizing protocols with which to "Secure, Contain, and
Protect" a catalog of creepy anomalous artifacts.</p>
<p>One of the arcs to break the churning surface of that crowd-sourced
fictional milieu is that of the
<a href="http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/antimemetics-division-hub">Antimemetics Division</a>:</p>
<p><em>"An antimeme is an idea which, by its intrinsic nature, discourages people
from spreading it. Think of ideas that you wouldn't share - passwords,
taboos, shameful secrets.</em></p>
<p><em>Anomalous antimemes are another matter entirely. How do you contain
something you can't record, or remember? How do you fight an enemy when you
can never even know you're at war?</em></p>
<p><em>Welcome to the Antimemetics Division.</em></p>
<p><em>No, this is not your first day."</em></p>
<p>Intrigued, I started clicking around, and as is the way of SCP, discovered
many hours had passed. Shortly afterwards, I realized the arc has been
collected into this book.</p>
<p>Occasional SCP entries, in the format we know and love, intertwine a short but
intense tale of memetic hazards, populated by a few of the Division's
finest - those rare individuals who can go from the standing start of a hint
that their memories can't be trusted, to a well-executed plan based upon
a stack of assumptions about what might be needed, and what might already have
been done that they can count upon, even though they no longer remember any of
it, without ever retaining any knowledge of their situation, or what they're up
against. I don't think I've ever been so impressed by the sheer depth of a
character's resourcefulness and initiative.</p>
<p>The journey does contain world-ending hellscapes, with some gore, which might
not be everyone's cup of tea. But it's short and somehow manages to stay light
in tone, so isn't emotionally arduous on that front.</p>
<p>Probably my favorite fiction of the year.</p>
<p>For those like me with an epub fetish,
you can buy <em>There is No Antimememtics Division</em> in many formats,
including Amazon links, EPUBs, or free-to-read online,

<p>Fabulous short story, <a href="https://qntm.org/mmacevedo">Lena</a> by qntm, riffs on
<a href="http://www.scpwiki.com/">SCP</a>'s idea of a work of fiction as a wiki entry.
But this is entirely standalone, not part of the SCP universe, and more
resembles a Wikipedia entry. Seems both genuinely scary and almost inevitable.</p>
<p>The title stems from the image above, head-and-shoulders hurriedly torn from
the centerfold of a colleague's issue of Playboy in 1972, while searching for
an image to use in an image processing conference paper. From this, we can
infer the proper pronunciation is <em>Lenna</em>, as in the name of the model.</p>
<p>This image has been widely re-used in scientific journals for decades. It has
some objectively useful properties - good dynamic range, details and flat
regions, shading and texture. However, its viral popularity most probably stems
overwhelmingly from its racy nature, featuring an attractive woman, used in
male-dominated fields. This was in contrast to other common test images of
the time, derived from dull 1960s television standards work.</p>
<p>The common long term use of the image was done without the knowledge or
permission of Playboy magazine - the copyright holder - or Lena herself. Over
the years they each became aware of it, and made their peace with it. By 2019,
though, Lena stated that the image, like her, ought to be retired.</p>

<p><em>by Ian J. Deary (1st Ed, 2001)</em></p>
<p>An expert's overview for the layman, describing how and why people differ in
their thinking powers, Very data driven, and by necessity, largely driven by
consideration of how to measure different aspects of intelligence, and
therefore what aspects intelligence can be teased apart into, such as working
memory, linguistic comprehension, perceptual organization, and speed of
operation.</p>
<p>Each chapter tackles a key scientific question, describing the experiments
that were done to determine the answers, showing the actual
key experimental datasets.</p>
<p>Such questions include: Is intelligence determined by genes or the environment?
The answer is 50/50, although surprisingly, little of the environmental
influence is due to the family raising the child. Also, the effect of genetics
increases with age.</p>
<p>How does a person's intelligence change as they age? Some skills show a
straight decline from age 25 to 80, such as inductive reasoning, spatial
awareness, perceptual speed and verbal memory. Other skills show a peak in
middle-age, with only a small decline at high ages, such as verbal reasoning
and numerical ability. The amount of mental decline with age is highly variable
between different people. Those whose abilities decline the least have no
cardio issues or chronic disease, have high social class, live in complex and
stimulating environments, and are generally satisfied with life, and unstressed
through middle age.</p>
<p>Does intelligence, especially as measured using existing tests, correlate with
life outoutcomes such doing well at a job? Depending on the job, yes, a great
deal. What sort of tests are good for predicting who will do well? Work
samples, structured interviews, and psychometric tests all give slightly over
0.5 correlations. Which isn't stellar, but it's the best we've got. At the
other end of the scale, graphology (handwriting) and age rankings had no
correlation.</p>
<p>It's a short book, with a lively style, densely packed with important
conclusions, and descriptions of how the field has arrived at them. Edifying.</p>
