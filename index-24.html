<p><em>by Ian J. Deary (1st Ed, 2001)</em></p>
<p>An expert's overview for the layman, describing how and why people differ in
their thinking powers, Very data driven, and by necessity, largely driven by
consideration of how to measure different aspects of intelligence, and
therefore what aspects intelligence can be teased apart into, such as working
memory, linguistic comprehension, perceptual organization, and speed of
operation.</p>
<p>Each chapter tackles a key scientific question, describing the experiments
that were done to determine the answers, showing the actual
key experimental datasets.</p>
<p>Such questions include: Is intelligence determined by genes or the environment?
The answer is 50/50, although surprisingly, little of the environmental
influence is due to the family raising the child. Also, the effect of genetics
increases with age.</p>
<p>How does a person's intelligence change as they age? Some skills show a
straight decline from age 25 to 80, such as inductive reasoning, spatial
awareness, perceptual speed and verbal memory. Other skills show a peak in
middle-age, with only a small decline at high ages, such as verbal reasoning
and numerical ability. The amount of mental decline with age is highly variable
between different people. Those whose abilities decline the least have no
cardio issues or chronic disease, have high social class, live in complex and
stimulating environments, and are generally satisfied with life, and unstressed
through middle age.</p>
<p>Does intelligence, especially as measured using existing tests, correlate with
life outoutcomes such doing well at a job? It depends greatly on the job, but
for some jobs, yes, a great deal. What sort of tests are good for discovering
who will do well (work samples; structured interviews; psychometric tests all
give slightly over 0.5 correlation with good job performance. Which isn't
stellar, but it's the best we've got. At the other end of the scale, graphology
(handwriting) and age rankings had no correlation.</p>
<p>It's a short book, with a lively style, densely packed with important
conclusions, and descriptions of how researchers arrived at them. Edifying.</p>

<p>I've previously only ever used git's regular <em>lightweight</em> tags, created with
<code>git tag TAGNAME</code>.</p>
<p>Today I learned about <em>annotated</em> tags, created with <code>git tag -a -m "MESSAGE"
TAGNAME</code>. If you don't specify <code>-m MESSAGE</code>, git annoyingly prompts you for
one, but it will accept <code>-m ""</code>.</p>
<p>Annotated tags store the creator, created timestamp, and the message. This
might occasionally be useful for understanding what happened. A release tagged
this way shows us who created the release, and when, which might differ from
when the commit was created.</p>
<p>But more importantly is the different handling of lightweight versus
annotated tags when pushing to the server.</p>
<p>Habitually, I've been using:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">git push --tags
</pre>
<p>This is slightly broken, in that it pushes <em>all</em> tags. Some tags might be
intended as my private local development state. Some of them might be
unreachable in the origin repo.</p>
<p>To fix this, git push introduced: <code>--follow-tags</code>, which aims to address these
issues by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only pushing annotated tags (hence, lightweight tags can be used as local,
  private state)</li>
<li>Only pushing tags that are on an ancestor of the commit being pushed. Hence
  no unreachable tags are created on the origin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Or alternatively, just push the tag name directly:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">git push TAGAME
</pre>
<p>Upshot:</p>
<ul>
<li>For private local state, use regular lightweight tags.
  Never push them. Hence never use <code>git push --tags</code>.</li>
<li>For public shared tagging, such as releases, use annotated tags,
  pushed either individually by name, or by using <code>--follow-tags</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>‰ or <em>'per mille'</em> means parts per thousand.</p>
<p>I wasn't aware of it until today when I idly Googled "permil", my imagined
variation on "percent", to find that this is one of the many spellings of
a real thing. Rarely used in English, but more common in other European
languages.</p>

<img alt="The Structure of Scientific Revolutions cover" src="files/2020/the-structure-of-scientific-revolutions-cover.jpg"></span></p>
<p><em>by Thomas S. Kuhn, 1962.</em></p>
<p>I loved <em>The Structure of Scientfic Revolutions</em>.
It was recommended to me as having similar impact to undergraduate
classics like <em>Godel, Escher, Bach</em>, or <em>The Blind Watchmaker.</em> I'm going
to just summarize the content here, so: Spoilers.</p>
<p>It begins by observing that discredited scientific theories, even those
which seem laughable today, such as phrenology, or the Ptolemaic model of the
heavens, were not crackpot theories with shaky evidence. Earnest, hardworking
practitioners refined them using sensible processes, which by the 17th century
were converging on the modern scientific method.</p>
<p>This process of "normal" science excels at the incremental refinement of
established scientific theories. But in practice, is unable to perform the
revolutionary transitions required to overcome outmoded theories and replace
them with others, no matter how bizarre and wrongheaded the initial theory
looks to us now with hindsight.</p>
<p>So what is the unarticulated process that is responsible for these
transitions, i.e. how do scientific revolutions happen? We have intuitive
visions of this occurring overnight. An individual experiment yields unexpected
results, contradicting conventional theory, while irrefutably supporting an
alternate theory to take its place. But in practice, this <em>never</em> happens.</p>
<p>At first, and often for years or centuries, no discrepancy between theory and
experiment is noticed, because the prevailing theories of the time have a
massive shaping effect on what questions it is valid to ask, what experiments
are deemed useful to do.</p>
<p>For practitioners to turn their backs on an established theory in such a time
is never productive. They are shunned for turning their backs on science
itself.</p>
<p>We see this vividly today with homeopaths (my own example, not the book's).
Often, and incorrectly, homeopathy is mocked because the theories sound
ridiculous to one steeped in a conventional understanding of chemistry.
People will jeer at how total dilution can 'obviously' have no effect,
or at the idea of water exhibiting some sort of 'memory'. But such jeering is
as scientifically illiterate as the quacks it contends with. The argument from
personal incredulity has no place in determining scientific truth. No newer
theory makes sense in the light of the more limited, and often contradictory,
paradigm that it eventually replaces. The only useful criteria is to try it
out. <em>Does it actually work?</em> This is the axis upon which homeopathy should be
judged. (and upon which it has decisively been found wanting.)</p>
<p>All contradictions to conventional science suffer a similar ignominious
treatment, regardless of how right they might later turn out to be. Before any
revolution of theory can overturn conventional understanding, the stage
must be set, the community prepared.</p>
<p>The process begins as the incremental advances of "normal" science gradually
increase the scope and precision of accepted theories. Until this point,
measurements in which experiment does not conform to theory are either ignored
as erroneous artifacts, or are dismissed as indicative of some separate,
unknown phenomena. They are never interpreted to mean prevailing theory is
wrong.</p>
<p>However the growing scope &amp; precision of theory and measurement gradually
uncovers more of these discrepancies, or reveals them in finer detail.
Eventually they become too prominent to ignore, and a kind of phase transition
occurs.</p>
<p>Eventually, the discrepancies become so prominent and concerning that they
are judged to be a valid area of study in themselves, rather than just annoying
aberrations. Leading practitioners devote themselves to the task. Foundations
of the specialisation that were once accepted without question now come under
scrutiny.</p>
<p>To partially explain the discrepancies, people introduce many incompatible
variations on current theories. The once unified field divides into cliques,
supporting different theoretical variations. The field, formerly a united mass,
calves into fragments.</p>
<p>If one of these variations on existing theory manages to explain all
observations, then this gradually gains mindshare, until the whole community
has migrated to this new, incrementally improved theory.</p>
<p>However, in cases where a truly revolutionary change is required, such
incrementalism is insufficient, and none of the theoretical variations are
fully successful in explaining all observations. The factions' differing
underlying assumptions give them no common ground upon which to arbitrate their
differences, so their debates are irreconcilable. The fragments are melting,
into a churning liquid of disagreement.</p>
<p>This state is notably similar to the state of a nascent field before any
established scientific theories have taken hold.</p>
<p>All is chaos, with different groups supporting different ideas, agreeing on
nothing. The field is in turmoil, its practitioners in genuine emotional
distress. Their personal identities are undermined. What does it mean to be a
practitioner when nobody can agree on what the field even is? Is what we do
even <em>science</em> at all? A crisis has arrived. We are at boiling point.</p>
<p>Kuhn compares this to individuals in psychological experiments, given cunningly
contradictory sensual stimuli. At first they don't notice anything wrong about
a brief glimpse of a playing card showing a red king of clubs. As the length of
their glimpse expands, and the stimulation becomes more intrusive, the subject
starts to hesitate, and stumble on words. Suddenly it impinges on their
consciousness, and they cry out, distressed, uncertain of even basic facts. "My
God! What did I see? Are clubs always red? What's happening here?"</p>
<p>Kuhn also compares scientific revolutions to their social and political
counterparts, in a chillingly familiar passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Political revolutions aim to change political institutions in ways that
those institutions themselves prohibit. Their success therefore necessitates
the partial relinquishment of one set of institutions in favor of another, and
in the interim society is not fully governed by institutions at all.</p>
<p>Initially it is crisis alone that attenuates the role of political
institutions [...] In increasing numbers, individuals become increasingly
estranged from political life, and behave more &amp; more eccentrically within
it.</p>
<p>Then, as the crisis deepens, many individuals commit themselves to [...] some
new institutional framework. At that point, society is divided into competing
camps or parties, one seeking to defend the old institutional constellation,
others seeking to institute some new one.</p>
<p>Once that polarization has occurred, <em>political recourse fails</em>. Because
they differ about the political matrix within which political change is to be
achieved and evaluated, and acknowledge no common supra-institutional framework
for adjudication of differences, the parties to a revolutionary conflict must
finally resort to the techniques of mass persuasion, often including force."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At any point, the <em>boldest</em> practitioners, often those with least invested in
the previous status quo, such as the relatively young, or those entering from
adjacent fields, will introduce strikingly different sets of theories. But only
now that the stage is set, amongst such distressing chaos, is the community
ready to entertain truly revolutionary ideas.</p>
<p>Occasionally, one of these new ideas will succeed in explaining all the
observations, but in order to do so, it requires incommensurable changes in the
underlying philosophy of the field, from the axiomatic definitions, to the set
of questions that are valid to ask. One can no longer ask, of a spherical
Earth, "What happens if you fall off?"</p>
<p>Notably, many revolutionary changes are not an unalloyed good. Gains in
explicative power in one area are often balanced by losses elsewhere.</p>
<p>As in evolution, the new theory is not necessarily more <em>correct</em>, so much as
it is a better fit for the current circumstances, i.e. providing greater
predictive power in an area that is currently pertinent. Maybe scientific
progress is more obviously useful to society in that area, or instruments are
more capable of making measurements in that area. The two often coincide,
since influences are are unable to detect or manipulate are also unlikely to
be of much direct use to society. So as the social and technological context
evolves, so does the relative fitness of potential competing paradigms.</p>
<p>Nobody understands this trade-off more deeply than the field's most
invested practitioners, who feel the losses of losing the old model most
keenly, and therefore may resist the new paradigm for the remainder of their
careers. The new paradigm will not achieve total dominance until the field is
populated by a whole new generation.</p>
<p>I am reminded of the dark priesthood of command-line programmers, although
I note with no little joy that our merry band includes some of the best and
brightest of the next generation (as judged by my own paradigm's criteria.)</p>

<p>Black, the opinionated Python code formatter, can easily be invoked from your
editor to reformat a whole file. For example, from Vim:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="c">" Black(Python) format the whole file</span>
<span class="nb">nnoremap</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>leader<span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="k">b</span> :<span class="m">1</span><span class="p">,</span>$<span class="p">!</span>black <span class="p">-</span><span class="k">q</span> <span class="p">-&lt;</span>CR<span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre>
<p>But often you'd like to reformat just a section of the file, while leaving
everything else intact. In principle, it's easy to tell Vim to just send the
current visual selection:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="c">" Black(Python) format the visual selection</span>
xnoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span>Leader<span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="k">b</span> :<span class="p">!</span>black <span class="p">-</span><span class="k">q</span> <span class="p">-&lt;</span>CR<span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre>
<p>(Note that both the above Vim configuration snippets map the same key
sequence -- leader (commonly comma) followed by lower case b. These can be
defined simultaneously, because the second one uses 'xnoremap', meaning it is
used only while a visual selection exists, while the first uses 'nnoremap', so
is used all other times.)</p>
<p>But if the given code starts with an indent on the first line, for example if
it comes from lines in the middle of a function, then this won't work. Black
parses the given code into a Python abstract syntax tree (AST), and a leading
indent is a syntax error - it's just not valid Python.</p>
<p>I filed a hopeful <a href="https://github.com/psf/black/issues/1352">issue with Black</a>,
suggesting they could handle this case, but it was a long shot and hasn't
gained much enthusiasm.</p>
<p>So, I present a tiny Python3 wrapper, <em>enblacken</em>, which:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unindents the given code such that the first line has no indent.</li>
<li>Passes the result to Black.</li>
<li>Reindents Black's output, by the same amount as the original unindent.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would be interested in seeing some example lxd config files,

<p>Here goes then.</p>
<p>I have one LXD container running for each nontrivial development project I'm
working on.</p>

<p>Out of the gate we see one source of confusion. "LXD", the daemon, is a
newer project that builds on top of "LXC" the containers. However the user
interface to all the new LXD-goodness is through a command-line called "lxc",
which replaces the older command line tool called "lxd". :-/</p>
<p>To create a new one:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">$ <span class="nb">time</span> lxc launch ubuntu:16.04 -p default -p jhartley demo
Creating demo
Starting demo
real    0m9.593s
</pre>
<p>Once created, they take about 3 seconds to stop and 0.5 seconds to start.</p>
<p>Those "-p" options cause the container to use two <em>profiles</em>. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The <em>default</em> profile, which I've never touched. It's just doing whatever it
   always does.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>jhartley</em> profile, I created in a one-off step by running a Bash script
   derived from instructions one of my colleagues passed around. I'll describe
   it at the end.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once a new container is up, we can execute commands directly on it:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>$ lxc <span class="nb">exec</span> demo hostname
demo
$ lxc <span class="nb">exec</span> demo whoami
root
</code></pre>

<p>Or SSH to them using their IP address:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">jhartley@t460 $ lxc ls demo
<span class="p">|</span> NAME <span class="p">|</span>  STATE  <span class="p">|</span>        IPV4         <span class="p">|</span> IPV6 <span class="p">|</span>   TYPE    <span class="p">|</span> SNAPSHOTS <span class="p">|</span>

jhartley@t460 $ ssh <span class="m">10</span>.44.99.162

<p>Better than using IP addresses, you can run a DNS server to recognize
<code>{containername}.lxd</code> hostnames. (This part is from
<a href="https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/a-way-to-resolve-container-lxd-from-host-in-all-cases/3698">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Find your lxd bridge IPv4 address</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">lxc network show lxdbr0
</pre>
<p>Create file <code>/etc/systemd/network/lxd.network</code>:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="k">[Match]</span>
<span class="na">Name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">lxdbr0</span>

<span class="k">[Network]</span>
<span class="na">Address</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">IPADDR/24</span>
<span class="na">DNS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">IPADDR</span>
<span class="na">Domains</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">~lxd</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Where IPADDR is the lxdbr0 IPv4 address.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">sudo systemctl <span class="nb">enable</span> systemd-networkd
sudo reboot now
</pre>
<p>Then:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">jhartley@t460 $ ssh demo.lxd
jhartley@demo $ <span class="c1"># \o/</span>
</pre>
<p>One nice thing is that DNS works both from the host and on the containers,
so your services can be configured by default to talk to each other at
SERVICE1.lxd, SERVICE2.lxd. Then running them in containers on your host
they would just find each other. We don't actually do this, but it seems
trivially easy to do. I should ask why we don't.</p>
<p>In practice I wrap up the ssh command with my accumulated foibles:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">jhartley@demo $ <span class="nb">type</span> -a lssh
lssh is a <span class="k">function</span>
lssh <span class="o">()</span>
<span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="nv">TERM</span><span class="o">=</span>xterm-color ssh -A -t <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$1</span><span class="s2">.lxd"</span> -- <span class="s2">"cd </span><span class="nv">$PWD</span><span class="s2"> &amp;&amp; exec </span><span class="nv">$SHELL</span><span class="s2"> -l"</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</pre>
<p>I forget why -A and -t were required. The rest is mostly just to start the
shell on the container in the same directory as I was in on the host. There
is probably a simpler way.</p>
<hr>
<p>The booooooring bits:</p>
<p>When we started the container, we mentioned
<a href="files/2020/setup-lxd-profile.sh">a one-off setup script</a>.</p>
<p>The script does a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creates a new key pair specifically to SSH to the container.</li>
<li>Creates the custom <em>jhartley</em> profile, which causes all containers started
   with it to:</li>
<li>Create a new user on the container with user and group ID mapped to
      those of my user on the host, presumably so that file permissions work
      for...</li>
<li>Mount my $HOME directory on the container. Might not always be what you
      want, but works for me right now.</li>
<li>Doubtless due to my own misunderstanding somewhere, in order to get working
   IPv4 connections to my containers, I had to disable IPv6 connections to
   them.</li>
</ol>
