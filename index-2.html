<p>It's the sort of nancy self-help psychobabble that would normally earn a
derisive snort from my direction, but the onset of middle-age is
broadening my horizons and dimming my discernment, so here I am, led to
it by the memories of difficult times in my own life, now sufficiently
distant for me to re-examine them, ponder how they changed me, and
wonder how I could have better handled both my contributions and
reactions to them.</p>
<p>To be sure, the author is at times a good deal more spiritual and
mystical than I have any taste for - her visit to a trailer-park psychic
may have been a revelationary and life-changing experience for her, but
despite the poetic appeal of the events therein, it wasn't for me, and
the specifics of the event would best have been omitted in trying to win
me over.</p>
<p>But having said that, with a little patience, I found a great deal of
value to be teased out of the other chapters. The overarching theme is
undeniable: that we fill our lives with superficial distractions, in our
efforts to keep up appearances, by design, we never have time or energy
left over for the difficult and unpleasant tasks of serious
introspection, of admitting and addressing our own flaws, or of
providing the openness and honesty needed by those close to us.</p>
<p>Even when jolted out of our habitual routine by a painful external
stimulus, such as personal injury or bereavement, in the hours or years
of soul-searching that follow, it is all too easy to remain wrapped up
in grief, anger or arrogance. But sometimes, in the depths of those dark
times, people learn how to overcome their own ego, and discern what is
truly important in their lives.</p>
<p>It sounds like a relentless downer, and it does indeed contain tales of
woe, but each story told within contains a message of hope. Pretences
drop, acceptance begins and honesty prevails. There are powerful lessons
in both self-awareness and humility to be learned here, and I'm glad it
found me when it did.</p>

<p>Alright, can I turn the smartalec cynicism back on now?</p>

<p><em>by Lisa Crispin &amp; Trip House.</em> 2003. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Testing-Extreme-Programming-Lisa-Crispin/dp/0321113551/">On Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>I grabbed this hoping that it might be the authoritative reference that
its position in the 'Xtreme Programming' series suggests, and it does
provides a descriptive overview of the testing responsibilities of both
developers and more conventional testers on an Extreme Programming
project. It touches all the bases, and even gets its hands dirty with
significant demonstration coding for <em>JUnit</em>, the venerable Java testing
framework. But beyond being a competent summary of the field, the book
seems to fall a little between two stools, and not necessarily through
any failing on the part of the authors.</p>
<p>If you're looking for more pragmatic guidance for test-driven
development in your own project's technical environment, then obviously
there's very little that would provide a better reward-to-investment
ratio than consulting the XUnit documentation for your own particular
language and platform, and implementing a test-driven project with it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you're looking for some more advanced topics, a
deeper exploration of the philosophies behind test-driven development,
of the nuanced differences between acceptance and unit tests, of how to
know when tests should be duplicating the semantics of your code and
when they should simply import directly from the tested code, or of the
more hare-brained ideas that test-driven development seems to lead
naturally into, such as genetic algorithms, then this book doesn't
provide it, and arguably never could have, since a lot of these things,
at the time of its writing, and arguably still, are still being thrashed
out by the development community.</p>
<p>In short, there was nothing in here that we aren't already doing at
<a href="http://resolversystems.com/">Resolver</a>. Boy am I grateful to be working
with these guys. :)</p>
<p>Rating:
9/10 if you don't know how to do test-driven development.
3/10 if you're already doing it.</p>

<p><em>by Larry Niven</em>. 1969-1973. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Flight-Horse-Larry-Niven/dp/1857238419">On Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>I just got this back from long-term loan to
<a href="http://frosties2.com/">Phil</a>, and I just couldn't resist reading it
clean through once again. It's a quick, light read, and I honestly
couldn't really justify my love of it to a dispassionate third party.
But Niven's stuff, particularly his early short stories like this, are
always a nostalgia trip for me, representative of the ideas that got me
into science fiction as a kid in the first place. He writes throwaway
tales of quirky worlds, but each one is crafted with such a singularly
consistent exploration of the logical implications of a single, simple
premise, that with hindsight, suddenly complicit in the gag, you can
almost see how each story's conclusion grew inescapably out of the very
opening paragraphs.</p>
<p>It's very much Niven's modus operandi, and it lends itself well to a
book like this, which is essentially a couple of sets of related short
stories, in settings that verge on fantasy, but which abide by a strict
internal logic that makes them indisputably hard SF to me.</p>
<p>The first sequence follows the fortunes of a 24th century
post-apocalyptic time traveller, who is trying his best to investigate
the past - our time, and pre-industrial ages - and bring back specimens
of long-extinct species. Things never quite go according to plan - the
horse he bags has an unexpected horn, and the whale he sought turns out
to be a biblical leviathan, until eventually, he figures out the hard
way what we the reader should have known all along - his time machine is
screwy, slipping a little <em>sideways</em> in time every time he travels back
to the past, sometimes a little, to worlds that differ from ours merely
in happenstance, or sometimes further, to worlds that never could have
been, in which mythical beasts roam and humanity is a very different
breed.</p>
<p>The second series explores a similarly simple premise - that countless
generations ago, deep in prehistory, when magic thrived and was a
practical art in the world, a sorcerer discovers a terrible secret: that
magic uses up energy from its surroundings, and that eventually this
<em>mana</em> runs out, leaving an area sterile of magical potential, deadly to
aged magicians, uninhabitable by mythical beasts. The knowledge is
exploited to further various agendas, a vicious cycle that accelerates
the process, that we the reader can see will inevitably lead to the fall
of their civilisation, and the immeasurable dark ages before our own
recorded history began.</p>
<p>It's the sort of stuff that people who don't 'do' SF clearly won't have
any patience for. But if you can conjour up a little willing suspension,
can overlook the writer's unsubtle early works, then the imagination and
clarity of the tales shines through, weaving entertaining worlds of both
humour and grandeur.</p>

<p>The LSO is enjoying a sustained peak of success, and is apparently
well-known for the talented and distinctive timbre of their brass
section, so it was with some interest that I found myself ushered along
to this opportunity to hear them strut their stuff from centre stage,
unencumbered by the rest of the orchestra. It was my first visit to the
2,000 seat Barbican Hall, which as venues go could not be in sharper
contrast to the Royal Albert Hall which hosted Susan and my last
orchestral outing. Along with most people, I wince at the heavy-handed
post-war modernist lines of its exterior, but nevertheless can't help
but admire the boldness and consistency with which such ambitious
architectural and social vision was applied to the entirely of the
enourmous Barbican Estate within which it nestles.</p>
<p>And being modern isn't all bad, because the manifold engineered
improvements to the concert hall's acoustics of the last couple of
decades seem very much to have produced the desired effect - I would
describe the clarity and range of sound to which my inexperienced ear
was subjected as nothing short of startling.</p>
<p>The ten-strong array of trumpets, trombones and tuba played a selection
to showcase their respective talents, with a zest and levity that I am
informed is their usual stock in trade, including Paul Archibald's brass
arrangement of Prokofiev's Ten Pieces for Piano, Op 12; Saint-Saëns'
Carnival of the Animals; Debussy's Keyboard Pieces; James Maynard's
Zoology and Gershwin's Porgy and Bess.</p>
<p>Not being overly familiar with orchestral music, the thing that struck
me was how much the exercise seemed to celebrate the precision and
craftsmanship that the musicians could bring to bear on the reproduction
of the music, rather than the sheer visceral joy of the music itself
which so predominag tes at a pop gig or night club. I'm told in no
uncertain terms by those with more experience of brass ensembles that
the experience of rhapsody is equally present, but I'm having trouble
reconciling that with my impressions of an audience which was captivated
and delighted, but also entirely motionless for the entire performance.
Somehow in my mind, the idea of overwhelming musical ecstasy is
inseparably associated with a irresistible, participatory physical
motion.</p>
<p>Clearly I have much to learn. Baby steps. :)</p>

    <p>Apologies in advance to the <a href="http://londonpython.org.uk/">London Python</a>
crowd, who I know are being force-fed these posts, for the bundle of
non-Python-related updates they are about to receive. Can anyone go and
look on the WordPress doc pages for me and figure out if there is plugin
to make the RSS feeds it generates specific to a particular combo of
site categories? Tar. :)</p>

<p><em>Director: Tony Scott.
Writer: Bill Marsilii &amp; Terry Rossio.
Starring: Denzel Washington, Paula Patton.
2006.</em></p>

<em>If you thought it was just a trick of the mind, prepare yourself for
the truth.</em></p>
<p>Turns out 'the truth' is a half-baked sci-fi thriller, with one or two
geek-cool moments involving a roving POV camera trick which can peer
into any nook or cranny you like, so long as it's exactly four and a
half days in the past. But there is no desire to even attempt any sort
of coherent explanation, or even try to consistently stick to the
logical implications of such a premise. It just forms the basis for some
expensive effects and the opportunity for Denzel to strut his stuff as a
typical hardass cop. If it wasn't for the fact I was trapped on a plane
with three hundred other unbearable people anyway, I'd want my two hours
back. Not even forgettable, more like regrettable, even for a sci-fi
dork like me.</p>
