I think *[Thief: The Dark
Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thief:_The_Dark_Project)* from 1998 is my
single favorite videogame of all time. Technically ambitious, it was the first
game to attempt "stealth" mechanics, which required modelling things like other
character's awareness of your presence and location, along with clues that would
alert them, such as your character's visibility according to the level of
illumination, and the modelling of sound propagation through environments, so
that, for example, characters would react appropriately if you dropped a plate
while out of sight, but perhaps remain unaware if intervening doors were closed.

On top of these fairly rudimentary mechanics, the team built a narrative
roller-coaster, dripping at every point with wonderful, atmospheric, emotional
highlights. It presents as a straightforward heist: getting into rich people's
houses in a pseudo-medieval City, to steal every last valuable you can find. But
it quickly breaks those expectations, introducing new elements and surprise
twists.

The first level lets you find your feet within this premise. Unlike most games,
a bombastic, confrontational approach will only lead to your skewering on the
end of a guard's sword. Instead you have to learn to evade and avoid. Stick to
the shadows, avoid those noisy tile floors. Find less-visible routes, across
rooftops, through windows, into the sewers, or maybe... behind that one guard
who is singing drunkenly to himself?

One of my most memorable moments from playing any videogame was from an early
point in that first level, when you first gain access to a rough basement, and
then upstairs into the mansion proper. A discordant musical crash punctuates the
unobtrusive tension-inducing background drumbeat. Otherwise, all is silent,
except for the creak of the door I'd just opened. The game had sold me
completely on the feeling that I was *breaking into somebody else's house*.
Nothing was happening, it was just me, hanging onto a door in the middle of a
fancy carpeted corridor, but my heart was pounding.

From that moment on, the game ups the ante again and again, breaking
expectations and providing shocking narrative twists, as we chuckle at some
puritanical religious nut-jobs and their ritualistic chants about the forces of
temptation, chaos and lies, personified as a chaotic devil-like Trickster,
driving the forces of nature, red in tooth and claw.

Later, a wealthy patron of our... unique talents double-crosses us after we
deliver rare ancient items, and reveals themselves to be the Trickster, who has
long sought these artifacts of power. He leaves us injured, and and promptly
goes to destroy the Hammers, who we realize were right after all. We feel
compelled to come to the aid of the Hammers, partly for revenge on the
Trickster, but also because -- well, we've never had the chance to pickpocket a
*demi-god* before.

We infiltrate the Trickster's lair, we disrupt his plans, steal his artifacts,
and banish him from this world. And then the game shows us the City as it
then comes to be as a result of our actions.

Snow is falling. Parks within the city die. The wilderness retreats. Magic
spells no longer work, so the city's magical lanterns are replaced by ugly,
noisy metal electrical ones. Ever more filthy factories get built, further
concentrating the City's wealth, setting the scene for the game's sequel "The
Metal Age" - which depicts an exploitative modernization of the quasi-medieval
setting, which we personally brought about. Our antihero pulls tight his cloak
against the cold, and disappears into the night.

My telling, no doubt, is underwhelming, but as an experience, it is
second-to-none.

I'm [not
alone](https://www.eurogamer.net/thief-the-dark-project-is-20-years-old-and-you-should-play-it-today)
in this gushing admiration -- the game has had a vibrant community steadily
producing fan-made extra levels ever since. The quality of these levels is
obviously variable, but the best of them has been quite astonishing, far
exceeding any expectations one might have had for narrative, atmosphere or sheer
artfulness, even within the confines of the aging game's technical limitations.

## The Black Parade

One such group of glorious loons has been hard at work at their collection of
levels, I guess that makes it a *campaign*, for the last seven years (!). They
released *The Black Parade* in 2024, and I only realised this very recently, so
I've been excitedly trying it out, and it is amazing.

One of the levels, number 4, *Death's Dominion*, an exploration of
abandoned underground catacombs, was proving difficult to navigate, so I was
drawn irresistibly into constructing a lovingly hand-drawn map for it, if only
to keep track of where I had or hadn't explored yet. Here it is:
