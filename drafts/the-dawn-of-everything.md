A dense read, rehashing Rousseau

The prevailing view of antiquity and prehistory suggests
that humans spent 95% of their evolutionary past in tiny egalitarian bands living
of hunter-gatherers, but as the population rose, this caused problems
of both productivity and organization that could only be solved by
agriculture and rigid hierarchical governments ruling over
nation states.

This view suggests, among other things, that the resulting modern world,
populated almost entirely by such nations, with occasional dwindling remnants
of culturally annihilated indiginous societies, is an inevitable outcome if the
human race is to sustain the population levels that seem necessary for
achievements such technology and material wealth. This inevitability deflects
blame for events that happened along the way, such as the atrocities of colonialism
and genocide.

The authors argue that revisiting the archeological record, and the contemporary
accounts of Indigenious peoples, 
for example by taking them at their word instead of liberally reinterpretting them as has
traditionally been done, suggests that the above view is incorrect.

In particular, ancient peoples did not live in tiny egalitarian bands, but employed
a surprising diversity of dynamic social and governments structures, which appear
to have been chosen with sophisticated political deliberation. The erroneous traditional
impression of a rise to modernity by abandoning primitive ways of living is wildly
misrepresentative, and on examination seems
have arisen from 18th century defensive conservative reactions to powerful critiques
of European society posed by Indigenous observers and intellectuals.

The investigation reveals much that is unexpected and suggests that the course of human history
may well be more contingent, and more full of playful, hopeful possibilities,
than we tend to assume. In particular, they suggest that the organization
into modern hierarchies or states, far from being inevitable, seems to be a historical accident.
The erasure of Indigenous societies wiped away 
all the varied and flourishing manifestations of social organization,
governance and individual freedom. This is at once is both heartbreaking for the monstrous
acts of history it reveals, but also hopeful, for all the diverse alternatives to currently accepted
modes of living it demonstrates, some of which might provide solutions to the maladies of
modern life, such as lack of meaning, poverty, iniquity, & epidemics of loneliness.

## Other media this month

Dave the Diver. Such unexpected glee from alternating between scuba diving
to hunt ever more exotic fish, and frantically working a sushi restaurant to serve them.
All wrapped around a vivid narrative core, driven by strong characters, reminiscent
of an old LucasArts adventure. Delicious!

[The Rewatchables](https://rewatchables.com/) podcast, 2017-present. New-to-me,
with hundreds of back episodes I'm gleefully trawling for movies I've
recently watched, to get the background, analysis and gossip. Often the
discussion is as long as the movie itself. The discussions are often quite
male-centric, but at least they're aware of this enough to call it out as a
weakness of some movies, as "by, about and for men", when warranted.

Babbdi. The only way to leave the weird deserted low-poly brutalist town of Babbdi is by train.
But how to get a ticket? Or even find the train n station? Cryptic clues are
dispensed by the occasional remaining inhabitant, all of whom have the
appearance of creepy manakin zombies.  Navigation and movement tools
are scattered around, such as a leaf blower that provides limited bursts of
propulsion. An excercise in exploratory diligence. (did-not-finish)

Suze wants to watch the latest *Guardians*, but I insisted the family ought to have
seen the highlights of the Infinity War arc first, so.
