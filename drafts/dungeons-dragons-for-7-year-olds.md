_For busy parents who might not know much about Dungeons & Dragons._

Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a game that's traditionally played by a handful of
friends around a table, largely consisting of conversation and imagination.
But the 180 pages of [official rules and
procedures](https://www.amazon.com/stores/DungeonsDragons/Homepage/page/9D7E0086-7547-4726-B258-E086D36914C3/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll2&tag=tartley-20&linkId=292040fe913e3028a5f5e03f443d040f&language=en_US)
are much too complex for younger kids. The following describes my made-up
variant of D&D, scaled down to a level that my seven year old and his friends
could enjoy.

D&D is a great opportunity to discuss big issues with kids, such as morality or
betrayal, in a context the kids _love_. It's especially brilliant at teasing
out enthusiastic interactions from kiddos that need extra social support, such
as those with autism, or any variety of loveable dork, by motivating them to
really engage with the ideas and each other, while providing natural excuse for
an adult to facilitate the social interactions around the table.

# Players

3 to 6 kids, plus one adult _dungeon master_ (that's you).

Ages: 7 to 14. Younger kids can happily join in, if they have have a helper
other than yourself to help them stay on track. Older kids might prefer the
real, full-blown,
[commercial D&D](https://www.amazon.com/stores/DungeonsDragons/Homepage/page/9D7E0086-7547-4726-B258-E086D36914C3/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll2&tag=tartley-20&linkId=292040fe913e3028a5f5e03f443d040f&language=en_US).

# Equipment

You'll need something like the following. It doesn't need to be these exact
products, so feel free to substitute.

* [Grid game mat](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MQHECUR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=tartley-20&linkId=83b76c731552bed91c9e3d3046ee4fe1&language=en_US).
* A few D20 & D6
* Paper
* Pencils
* Decent erasers

# Preparation

# Play

# Future sessions

# TODO

_Fragments that will fit in later:_

After two sentences on a topic, kids get bored, switch off, and wander away
from the table. Instead of a big description, you can just say "It's a scary,
ruined castle" - they get it.

# Addenda

I wrote this up because I could find very few resources for parents who want to
run a D&D game for younger kids. The standout exception to that is Susan J.
Morris' brilliant and trailblazing
[_Heroes of Hesiod_](www.wizards.com/dnd/files/MS_HeroesHesiod.pdf).
My goals have been to improve on that where I could. In particular I wanted to
provide characters, creatures, and scenarios that, like hers, you can print out
and use directly, but in a format that you can easily extend yourself, to
create an endless variety of subsequent play sessions. I'm keen to make this
simple enough that the kids themselves can start to contribute to scenario
creation, and then to dungeon master their own scenarios. In my experience,
after a few games, they all want to do this.
