    <p>The last few weeks I've been thinking about the architectural pattern
known as <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Clean, Onion, Hexagonal, or
Ports'n'Adaptors</a>.
I'm curious if many people are applying it in the Django world.</p>
<p>The premise is for your core application entity classes and business
rules to be plain old objects, with no dependencies. In particular, they
are not dependent on the interfaces between your application and
external systems, such as your persistence mechanism, or your web
framework. Instead, external interface components depend upon your core
business objects. This essentially moves the database from the 'bottom'
layer of the old traditional 'three layer architecture', to form a part
of the topmost layer - a sibling with the 'UI.'</p>
<p>For inbound messages (e.g handling a web request) this is
straightforward - Django calls your view code which calls your business
layer, but keep your business layer separate from your Django code, so
it is stand-alone and unit-testable. For outbound messages, such as then
rendering the web page in response, it's slightly more complicated: Your
business logic must pass the result (typically a pure data structure)
back to your web-aware code, but without your business logic depending
on the web-aware component. This requires an inversion of control.</p>
<p>That way, all your business logic can easily be tested in unit tests,
with no mocking required. You still need some end-to-end tests to verify
integration, but you shouldn't need to involve your UI or database in
testing every detail of your business logic.</p>
<p>Also, you can easily switch out your external system interfaces, such as
persistence, to use another RDBMS, another ORM, a NoSQL store, or an
in-memory version for testing Since the core of your application doesn't
have any dependency on these components, it is oblivious to the
change. The business logic, because it doesn't depend on Django, is no
longer riddled with Django's convenient ORM database access.</p>
<p>Same thing goes for switching out your web framework, or calling the
same logic from web UI or web API calls. And again, for switching out
your UI: add a command line application, or a console UI. The core
application logic is unaffected, and your new interface components
contain only the code that is specific to that interface's concerns.</p>
<p>Another side effect is that your web framework, if you're using one,
becomes a peripheral detail which depends upon your core application,
rather than the other way round. Your Django project would become a
subdirectory of your project, rather than dominating your project
directory structure. Since the business logic formerly contained within
it is now elsewhere (in your core business objects) the Django project
is now very thin. Views, for example, are delegations to single
business-layer functions. The Django project now contains just the
web-oriented aspects of your project, as it should.</p>
<p>These ideas all seem like relatively straightforward software
engineering, and I feel a bit foolish for not having been aware of them
all these years. I console myself that I'm not alone.</p>
<p>UncleBob's Ruby Midwest keynote "<a href="posts/hexagonal-django/%20http:/www.confreaks.com/videos/759-rubymidwest2011-keynote-architecture-the-lost-years">Architecture - The Lost
Years</a>"
attributes one source of this idea to Ivar Jacobsen's 1994 book <a href="posts/hexagonal-django/%20http:/www.amazon.co.uk/Object-oriented-Software-Engineering-Approach-Press/dp/0201544350">Object
Oriented Software Engineering : A Use Case Driven
Approach</a>
(2nd-hand hardbacks cheap on Amazon.)</p>
<p>I see a few people applying these ideas to Rails, but are many people
out there doing this in Django? I plan to refactor a small vertical
slice of our monster Django app into this style, to try and prove the
idea for myself.</p>

    <p><strong>Update:</strong> I've since switched to KeePassXC, the community fork of KeePassX,
an open source, cross-platorm, local-first, encrypted password storage program.</p>
<hr>
<p>My passwords and other miscellany are in a plain text file within an
encrypted zip. Since starting to use OSX I've been looking for a way to
access my passwords such that:</p>
<ul>
<li>I get prompted for the decryption password.</li>
<li>The file gets unzipped, but not in the same directory, because
    that's synced to Dropbox, so would send my plaintext passwords to
    them every time I accessed them. Maybe to /tmp?</li>
<li>The plaintext file within the zip is opened in \$EDITOR.</li>
<li>Wait for me to close \$EDITOR, then remove my plaintext passwords
    from the filesystem.</li>
<li>Before deleting the passwords, check if I've updated them. If so,
    put the new updated version back into the original zip file.</li>
<li>Don't forget to keep the updated zip file encrypted, using the same
    password as before, without prompting for it again.</li>
</ul>
<p>I failed to find an existing app which would do all this (although I had
no trouble on Linux or even on Windows.) Hence, resorting to good old
Bash:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="ch">#!/bin/bash</span>

<span class="nv">ZIPDIR</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span><span class="s2">/docs/org"</span>

<span class="k">fi</span>

<p>I don't expect this to be watertight, but seems good enough for today.
I'm happy to hear suggestions.</p>

    <p>I love the brilliant Vim plugin
<a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2441">pyflakes-vim</a>,
which highlights errors &amp; warnings, and since I got a MacBook for work,
I've been using MacVim a lot.</p>
<p>This combination has a problem, that MacVim uses the OSX system default
Python 2.6, so pyflakes is unable to handle Python 2.7 syntax, such as
set literals. These are marked as a syntax errors, which prevents the
rest of the file from being parsed.</p>
<p>The solution is to compile your own MacVim, using Python 2.7 instead of
the system Python. The following commands got MacVim compiled for me:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="ch">#!/bin/bash</span>
git clone git://github.com/b4winckler/macvim.git
<span class="nb">cd</span> macvim/src
<span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">LDFLAGS</span><span class="o">=</span>-L/usr/lib
./configure <span class="se">\</span>
    --with-features<span class="o">=</span>huge <span class="se">\</span>
    --enable-rubyinterp <span class="se">\</span>
    --enable-perlinterp <span class="se">\</span>
    --enable-cscope <span class="se">\</span>
    --enable-pythoninterp <span class="se">\</span>
    --with-python-config-dir<span class="o">=</span>/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/config
make
open MacVim/build/Release
<span class="nb">echo</span> Drag MacVim.app to your Applications directory
</code></pre>

<p>Without the LDFLAGS setting, I was missing some symbols at link. The
--with-python-config-dir entry came from typing 'which python' to find
where my Python 2.7 install lives, and modifying that result to find its
'config' directory (whatever that is) near to the binary.</p>
<p>As indicated, install by dragging the resulting
macvim/src/MacVim/build/Release/MacVim.app into your Applications
directory.</p>
<p>Open up MacVim, and check out the built-in Python version:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">python</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nb">print</span> <span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">version</span>
<span class="mf">2.7.1</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">r271</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">86882</span><span class="n">M</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Nov</span> <span class="mi">30</span> <span class="mi">2010</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">35</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">34</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>And files with set literals are now correctly parsed for errors.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> This only works if the Python 2.7 is your default 'python'
executable. Otherwise, or if you get "ImportError: No module named
site"?, see Richard's comments below.</p>

    <p>I'm finding that our Django project's tests fall into an uncomfortable
middle-ground, halfway between end-to-end acceptance tests and proper
unit tests. As such they don't exhibit the best qualities of either. I'd
like to fix this.</p>
<p>We're testing our Django application in what I believe is the canonical
way, as described by the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/testing/">excellent
documentation</a>.
We have a half-dozen Django applications, with a mixture of
<code>unittest.TestCase</code> and <code>django.test.TestCase</code> subclasses in each
application's tests.py module. They generally use fixtures or the Django
ORM to set up data for the test, then invoke the function-under-test,
and then make assertions about return values or side-effects, often
using the ORM again to assert about the new state of the database.</p>
<h3>Not an Acceptance Test</h3>
<p>Such a test doesn't provide the primary benefit of an acceptance test,
namely proof that the application actually works, because it isn't quite
end-to-end enough. Instead of calling methods-under-test, we should be
using the Django testing client to make HTTP requests to our web
services, and maybe incorporating Selenium tests to drive our web UI.
This change is a lot of work, but at least the path forward seems clear.</p>
<p>However, an additional problem is that acceptance tests ought to be
associated with features that are visible to an end user. A single user
story might involve calls to several views, potentially spread across
different Django apps. Because of this, I don't think it's appropriate
for an acceptance test to live within a single Django app's directory.</p>
<h3>Not a Unit Test</h3>
<p>On the other hand, our existing tests are also not proper unit tests.
They hit the (test) database and the filesystem, and they currently
don't do any mocking out of expensive or complicated function calls. As
a result, they are slow to run, and will only get slower as we ramp up
our feature set and our test coverage. This is a cardinal sin for unit
tests, and it discourages developers from running the tests frequently
enough. In addition, tests like this often require extensive setup of
test data, and are therefore hard to write, so it's very
labour-intensive to provide adequate test coverage.</p>
<h3>My Solution</h3>
<p><strong>1) I've created a top-level acceptancetests directory.</strong> Most of our
current tests will be moved into this directory, because they are closer
to acceptance tests than unit tests, and will gradually be modified to
be more end-to-end.</p>
<p>These acceptance tests need to be run by the Django testrunner, since
they rely on lots of things that it does, such as creating the test
database and rolling back after each test method. However, the Django
testrunner won't find these tests unless I make 'acceptancetests' a new
Django application, and import all acceptance test classes into its
tests.py. I'm considering doing this, but for the moment I have another
solution, which I'll describe in a moment.</p>
<p>We also need to be able to create unit tests for all of our code,
regardless of whether that code is within a Django model, or somewhere
else in a Django app, or in another top-level directory that isn't a
Django app. Such unit tests should live in a 'tests' package right next
to the code they test. I'm puzzled as to why Django's testrunner doesn't
look for unit tests throughout the project and just run them all, along
with the Django-specific tests.</p>
<p><strong>2) My solution to this is to augment the Django test runner</strong>, by
inheriting from it. My test runner, instead of just looking for tests in
each app's models.py and tests.py, looks for subclasses of
unittest.TestCase in every module throughout the whole project. Setting
Django's settings.TEST_RUNNER causes this custom test runner to be used
by 'manage.py test'. Thanks to the Django contributors for this
flexibility!</p>
<p>So the new test runner finds and runs all the tests which the default
Django runner runs, and it also finds our unit tests from all over the
project, and it also includes our new top-level 'acceptancetests'
directory. This is great!</p>
<p>One surprise is that the number of tests which get run has actually
decreased. On closer inspection, this is because the standard Django
test runner includes all the tests for every Django app, and this
includes not just my project's apps, but also the built-in and
middleware Django apps. We are no longer running these tests. Is this
important? I'm not sure: After all, we are not modifying the code in
django.contrib, so I don't expect these tests to start failing. On the
other hand, maybe those tests help to demonstrate that our Django
settings are not broken?</p>
<h3>An appeal for sanity</h3>
<p>My solutions seem to work, but I'm suspicious that I'm swimming against
the current, because I haven't found much discussion about these issues,
so maybe I'm just well off the beaten path. Have many other people
already written a similar extension to Django's test runner? If so,
where are they all? If not, why not? How else is everyone running their
Django project tests in locations other than models.py or tests.py? Or
do they not have tests outside these locations? If not, why not? I'd
love to hear about it if I'm doing it wrong, or if there's an easier
approach.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> My <a href="http://rangespan.com/">fabulous employer</a> has given
permission to release the test runner as open source:</p>

    <p>The usual solution to typing non-US characters on a US keyboard in
Windows is to hold left-alt, then type on the numeric keypad:</p>
<p>£   Left-alt + 0163</p>
<p>€   Left-alt + 0128</p>
<p>This is a pain on my (otherwise fabulous) Thinkpad laptop, because the
numeric keypad is accessed by holding the blue 'Fn' key while you tap
ScrLk, to toggle numeric keypad mode, and then doing the same again
afterwards to turn it off.</p>
<p>One inadequate alternative (on WindowsXP, YMMV) is to go into control
panel; Regional and Language Options; Languages; Details; Settings. Add
a new keyboard configuration, "United States-International", which
should be grouped under your existing language ("English (United
Kingdom)" for me.) OK all the dialogs, restart your applications.</p>
<p>Now you can simply type:</p>
<p>£   Right-alt + Shift + 4</p>
<p>€   Right-alt + 5</p>
<p>The downside of this solution is that the "UnitedStates-International"
keyboard setting adds a bunch of other features, including 'dead-keys',
whereby quotes and other punctuation are used to add accents to letters,
which is overly intrusive if, like me, you hardly ever use accents.</p>
<p>Ultimate solution then, define your own personal keyboard layout.

<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964665">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964665</a>.</p>
<p>My end result is an MSI with which I can install a new keyboard layout,
which is exactly like 'US', but with the addition of £ on the key
right-alt + 3:</p>

<p>The source .klc file is in there, so you could add your own tweaks on
top of that.</p>

    <p>Another brainstorming project idea:</p>
<p>Some projects have a suite of tests which take a long time to run. This
hinders agility.</p>
<p>We could run these tests suites for clients across EC2 instances. We've
had great success at Resolver Systems in slicing a test run across
several machines and then recombining the results. No doubt some people
have similar solutions. In taking the hassle of configuring these
machines out of your hands, we could divide the test suite execution
time to a fraction of that taken running them in serial on a single
machine.</p>
<p>Additionally, we could run tests against multiple versions of Python, or
run acceptance / system tests, on multiple browsers. These can all be
run in parallel across as many instances as it takes.</p>
<p>The downside of this idea is that unit tests run very quickly, so we
provide no value there. Only for long-running acceptance tests is this a
useful service - and those are tricky because they so often require so
much custom configuration and resources in order to run. Also, like our
own acceptance tests, they may be running on Windows clients, which is a
more expensive VM to run on EC2.</p>
<p>I don't <em>think</em> it could be made to work with an arbitrary set of
projects' tests - the differences between how each project writes and
runs their tests are just too great. But we could provide a sort of
'snakebite light' - an available bunch of servers with a variety of
Python and browser versions which people could write tests to run
against.</p>
<p>Do many people have long-running acceptance tests suites that would run
on a cheap Linux-based VM? How comfortable would people be outsourcing
this sort of service which is so fundamental to your project? Do you
think we'd be overwhelmed by the difficulties inherent in custom
configuration each project would need to run their tests? Again, if you
love or hate this idea, I'd love to hear about it.</p>

    <p>We've been brainstorming for products to build. What do you think of
this one?</p>
<p><strong>Python Interactive Console in the Browser</strong></p>
<p>One idea is a CPython interactive console in the browser. Client is
Javascript, which sends the user's Python to execute in a sandbox on our
EC2 instances. Dirigible already has the infrastructure to support
running our user's arbitrary Python in a sandbox across our grid - so
we'd only need to strip the spreadsheet-UI off to expose this
functionality to end-users.</p>
<p><a href="files/2011/04/python-in-browser.png"><img alt="Python in the browser" src="files/2011/04/python-in-browser.png" title="Python in the browser"></a></p>
<p>Your console state is persistant - so you could start some
investigation, or a long-running statement, then log off, and then
reconnect to it later from another machine.</p>
<p>Since the Python runs on our servers, all the client needs is a working
browser with Javascript. You could run code from any device - even funky
things like iPads which don't traditionally make installing and running
Python very easy. Your only hinderance would be the keyboard. Since our
servers could be beefy, it would run substantially faster. We could help
to support running in parallel across several servers.</p>
<p>We could provide multiple versions of Python - and keep them fully
loaded with packages from PyPI - so you could use any combo without
having to install anything locally.</p>
<p>There are already <a href="http://www.trypython.org" title="trypython">some</a>
<a href="http://runroot.com/" title="runroot">examples</a>
<a href="http://shell.appspot.com" title="AppEngine shell">of</a>
<a href="http://www.datamech.com/devan/trypython/trypython.py" title="datamech">in-browser</a>
<a href="http://www.skulpt.org/" title="skulpt">Python</a> consoles like this, but none
of them quite do what we'd hope to do.</p>
<p>We're also thinking of providing really simple tools so you could work
on scripts or programs locally, and then run them in the cloud with a
single command / button.</p>
<p>Generally we're thinking of running your stuff on our own EC2 servers.
Other applications might involve executing stuff on your own servers,
instead of ours, but thus far we haven't come up with applications of
this that offer much over fabric or a combination of an SSH session and
Unix program 'screen'.</p>
<p>Would you use this? What for? Do you think it's totally dumb? I'd love
to hear about it.</p>
<p><em>Most</em> interestingly, would you pay for it? We're thinking free for
trivial uses, a few dollars for some advanced features (access to
networking, persistance) and scale up to support teraflop computing.</p>

    <p><strong>Update:</strong> All of the below is made totally redundant by simply using
<code>gitk --all</code>. Thanks Russel!</p>
<hr>
<p>When I launch Gitk, it just displays the current branch. To display
other branches, you must name them on the command line. To display all
existing branches, you need to find out all the branch names:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>$ git branch
  create-sql-dev
  formula-rewrite
* master
</code></pre>

<p>Then laboriously type them in to the gitk command line:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>$ gitk create-sql-dev formula-rewrite master
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, save this Bash snippet in a script on your PATH. I call
mine gitka, for 'all branches':</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="ch">#!/usr/bin/bash</span>
<span class="c1"># run gitk, displaying all existing branches</span>
<span class="k">for</span> b <span class="k">in</span> <span class="s2">"`git branch`"</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$b</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">done</span> <span class="p">|</span> tr -d <span class="s2">"*"</span> <span class="p">|</span> xargs gitk
</code></pre>

<p><img alt="Gitk displaying all branches, not just the current ('master' in bold)" src="files/2010/12/gitk-all-branches.png" title="gitk-all-branches"></p>
<p>This works on Windows too, if you save it as 'gitka.sh', and have Cygwin
installed and associate the .sh filename extension with the Cygwin Bash
executable. You can then run it as 'gitka' from a Windows command prompt
thingy. If you then use 'ln -s gitka.sh gitka', then you can also run it
as just 'gitka' from a Cygwin bash prompt too - without this you would
have had to type out the full 'gitka.sh'.</p>

    <p>How to set up and configure Vim to use tags for Python development so
that it doesn't suck.</p>
<h3>Install Ctags</h3>
<p>Get the latest version of <a href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/">ctags</a>, put it
on your PATH. Recent releases are much improved for Python.</p>
<h3>Creating or updating tags files</h3>
<p>You'll probably want one tags file at the root of your project, which
will need to be created or updated whenever you make significant
changes. Either get used to manually running the following command a
lot:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>ctags -R .
</code></pre>

<p>or bind it to a key in your \~/.vimrc:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>map  :<span class="p">!</span><span class="k">start</span> /min ctags <span class="p">-</span>R .
</code></pre>

<p>I like to set Vim's current working directory equal to the root of
whatever project I'm working in, so now I can press f12 to update the
tags file for the project. The 'start /min' part is a Windows-specific
way to run the command in the background, so Vim isn't locked up waiting
for it to finish.</p>
<h3>Test it out</h3>
<p>Now, in Vim, ctrl-] will jump to the definition of the symbol under
your text cursor. Hooray, etc. If there is more than one definition of
that symbol, it presents a menu for you to choose from.</p>
<h3>Turn off useless tags</h3>
<p>By default, ctags generates tags for Python functions, classes, class
members, variables and imports. The last two are useless to me, and they
actually make ctrl-] more inconvenient, because they increase the
likelyhood of finding duplicate definitions of a tag, causing the menu
to inconveniently pop up, rather than just jumping to the tag you want.</p>
<p>To fix this, create a \~/.ctags file:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>--python-kinds<span class="o">=</span>-iv
--exclude<span class="o">=</span>build
--exclude<span class="o">=</span>dist
</code></pre>

<p>The first line turns off tags generation for variables and imports. The
second and third lines turn off generation of tags in the named dirs,
since you almost certainly want to ignore source code in those
directories.</p>
<h3>Case insensitive tag matching</h3>
<p>If your .vimrc requests case-insensitive searching by setting
<em>ignorecase</em> (aka <em>ic</em>), then the above tag matching will also be case
insensitive. This is irksome, because searching for the definition of
property <em>.matrix</em> will present you with a menu asking you to choose
between property <em>.matrix</em> and class <em>Matrix</em>, rather than just jumping
to the property.</p>
<p>To fix this, add this to your .vimrc:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="c">" go to defn of tag under the cursor</span>
<span class="k">fun</span><span class="p">!</span> MatchCaseTag<span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nb">ic</span> <span class="p">=</span> &amp;<span class="nb">ic</span>
    <span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">noic</span>
    <span class="k">try</span>
        exe <span class="s1">'tjump '</span> . expand<span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">''</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">finally</span>
       <span class="k">let</span> &amp;<span class="nb">ic</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="nb">ic</span>
    <span class="k">endtry</span>
<span class="k">endfun</span>
<span class="nb">nnoremap</span>   :<span class="k">call</span> MatchCaseTag<span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>This Vim script was suggested in a comment by James Vega, in
order to reliably restore the state of 'ignorecase' after doing the tag
jump. Many thanks!</p>
<p>This maps your ctrl-] key to turn off case-insensitivity while it does
the jump to tag, then turn it back on again. Now pressing ctrl-] will
jump directly to your property, only presenting menus on the occasion
when the tag you search for is defined in more than one place using
precisely the same name.</p>
<p>Much better.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Also see this post about adding stdlib and venv contents to
your tags:
