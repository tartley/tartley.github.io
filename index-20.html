<p>Another brainstorming project idea:</p>
<p>Some projects have a suite of tests which take a long time to run. This
hinders agility.</p>
<p>We could run these tests suites for clients across EC2 instances. We've
had great success at Resolver Systems in slicing a test run across
several machines and then recombining the results. No doubt some people
have similar solutions. In taking the hassle of configuring these
machines out of your hands, we could divide the test suite execution
time to a fraction of that taken running them in serial on a single
machine.</p>
<p>Additionally, we could run tests against multiple versions of Python, or
run acceptance / system tests, on multiple browsers. These can all be
run in parallel across as many instances as it takes.</p>
<p>The downside of this idea is that unit tests run very quickly, so we
provide no value there. Only for long-running acceptance tests is this a
useful service - and those are tricky because they so often require so
much custom configuration and resources in order to run. Also, like our
own acceptance tests, they may be running on Windows clients, which is a
more expensive VM to run on EC2.</p>
<p>I don't <em>think</em> it could be made to work with an arbitrary set of
projects' tests - the differences between how each project writes and
runs their tests are just too great. But we could provide a sort of
'snakebite light' - an available bunch of servers with a variety of
Python and browser versions which people could write tests to run
against.</p>
<p>Do many people have long-running acceptance tests suites that would run
on a cheap Linux-based VM? How comfortable would people be outsourcing
this sort of service which is so fundamental to your project? Do you
think we'd be overwhelmed by the difficulties inherent in custom
configuration each project would need to run their tests? Again, if you
love or hate this idea, I'd love to hear about it.</p>

<p>We've been brainstorming for products to build. What do you think of
this one?</p>
<p><strong>Python Interactive Console in the Browser</strong></p>
<p>One idea is a CPython interactive console in the browser. Client is
Javascript, which sends the user's Python to execute in a sandbox on our
EC2 instances. Dirigible already has the infrastructure to support
running our user's arbitrary Python in a sandbox across our grid - so
we'd only need to strip the spreadsheet-UI off to expose this
functionality to end-users.</p>
<p><a href="files/2011/04/python-in-browser.png"><img alt="Python in the browser" src="files/2011/04/python-in-browser.png" title="Python in the browser"></a></p>
<p>Your console state is persistant - so you could start some
investigation, or a long-running statement, then log off, and then
reconnect to it later from another machine.</p>
<p>Since the Python runs on our servers, all the client needs is a working
browser with Javascript. You could run code from any device - even funky
things like iPads which don't traditionally make installing and running
Python very easy. Your only hinderance would be the keyboard. Since our
servers could be beefy, it would run substantially faster. We could help
to support running in parallel across several servers.</p>
<p>We could provide multiple versions of Python - and keep them fully
loaded with packages from PyPI - so you could use any combo without
having to install anything locally.</p>
<p>There are already <a href="http://www.trypython.org" title="trypython">some</a>
<a href="http://runroot.com/" title="runroot">examples</a>
<a href="http://shell.appspot.com" title="AppEngine shell">of</a>
<a href="http://www.datamech.com/devan/trypython/trypython.py" title="datamech">in-browser</a>
<a href="http://www.skulpt.org/" title="skulpt">Python</a> consoles like this, but none
of them quite do what we'd hope to do.</p>
<p>We're also thinking of providing really simple tools so you could work
on scripts or programs locally, and then run them in the cloud with a
single command / button.</p>
<p>Generally we're thinking of running your stuff on our own EC2 servers.
Other applications might involve executing stuff on your own servers,
instead of ours, but thus far we haven't come up with applications of
this that offer much over fabric or a combination of an SSH session and
Unix program 'screen'.</p>
<p>Would you use this? What for? Do you think it's totally dumb? I'd love
to hear about it.</p>
<p><em>Most</em> interestingly, would you pay for it? We're thinking free for
trivial uses, a few dollars for some advanced features (access to
networking, persistance) and scale up to support teraflop computing.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> All of the below is made totally redundant by simply using
<code>gitk --all</code>. Thanks Russel!</p>
<p>When I launch Gitk, it just displays the current branch. To display
other branches, you must name them on the command line. To display all
existing branches, you need to find out all the branch names:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>$ git branch
  create-sql-dev
  formula-rewrite
* master
</code></pre>

<p>Then laboriously type them in to the gitk command line:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>$ gitk create-sql-dev formula-rewrite master
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, save this Bash snippet in a script on your PATH. I call
mine gitka, for 'all branches':</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="ch">#!/usr/bin/bash</span>
<span class="c1"># run gitk, displaying all existing branches</span>
<span class="k">for</span> b in <span class="s2">"`git branch`"</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$b</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">done</span> <span class="p">|</span> tr -d <span class="s2">"*"</span> <span class="p">|</span> xargs gitk
</code></pre>

<p><img alt="Gitk displaying all branches, not just the current ('master' in bold)" src="files/2010/12/gitk-all-branches.png" title="gitk-all-branches"></p>
<p>This works on Windows too, if you save it as 'gitka.sh', and have Cygwin
installed and associate the .sh filename extension with the Cygwin Bash
executable. You can then run it as 'gitka' from a Windows command prompt
thingy. If you then use 'ln -s gitka.sh gitka', then you can also run it
as just 'gitka' from a Cygwin bash prompt too - without this you would
have had to type out the full 'gitka.sh'.</p>

<p>How to set up and configure Vim to use tags for Python development so
that it doesn't suck.</p>
<h3>Install Ctags</h3>
<p>Get the latest version of <a href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/">ctags</a>, put it
on your PATH. Recent releases are much improved for Python.</p>
<h3>Creating or updating tags files</h3>
<p>You'll probably want one tags file at the root of your project, which
will need to be created or updated whenever you make significant
changes. Either get used to manually running the following command a
lot:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>ctags -R .
</code></pre>

<p>or bind it to a key in your \~/.vimrc:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>map  :<span class="p">!</span><span class="k">start</span> /min ctags <span class="p">-</span>R .
</code></pre>

<p>I like to set Vim's current working directory equal to the root of
whatever project I'm working in, so now I can press f12 to update the
tags file for the project. The 'start /min' part is a Windows-specific
way to run the command in the background, so Vim isn't locked up waiting
for it to finish.</p>
<h3>Test it out</h3>
<p>Now, in Vim, ctrl-] will jump to the definition of the symbol under
your text cursor. Hooray, etc. If there is more than one definition of
that symbol, it presents a menu for you to choose from.</p>
<h3>Turn off useless tags</h3>
<p>By default, ctags generates tags for Python functions, classes, class
members, variables and imports. The last two are useless to me, and they
actually make ctrl-] more inconvenient, because they increase the
likelyhood of finding duplicate definitions of a tag, causing the menu
to inconveniently pop up, rather than just jumping to the tag you want.</p>
<p>To fix this, create a \~/.ctags file:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>--python-kinds<span class="o">=</span>-iv
--exclude<span class="o">=</span>build
--exclude<span class="o">=</span>dist
</code></pre>

<p>The first line turns off tags generation for variables and imports. The
second and third lines turn off generation of tags in the named dirs,
since you almost certainly want to ignore source code in those
directories.</p>
<h3>Case insensitive tag matching</h3>
<p>If your .vimrc requests case-insensitive searching by setting
<em>ignorecase</em> (aka <em>ic</em>), then the above tag matching will also be case
insensitive. This is irksome, because searching for the definition of
property <em>.matrix</em> will present you with a menu asking you to choose
between property <em>.matrix</em> and class <em>Matrix</em>, rather than just jumping
to the property.</p>
<p>To fix this, add this to your .vimrc:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="c">" go to defn of tag under the cursor</span>
<span class="k">fun</span><span class="p">!</span> MatchCaseTag<span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nb">ic</span> <span class="p">=</span> &amp;<span class="nb">ic</span>
    <span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">noic</span>
    <span class="k">try</span>
        exe <span class="s1">'tjump '</span> . expand<span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">''</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">finally</span>
       <span class="k">let</span> &amp;<span class="nb">ic</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="nb">ic</span>
    <span class="k">endtry</span>
<span class="k">endfun</span>
<span class="nb">nnoremap</span>   :<span class="k">call</span> MatchCaseTag<span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>This Vim script was suggested in a comment by James Vega, in
order to reliably restore the state of 'ignorecase' after doing the tag
jump. Many thanks!</p>
<p>This maps your ctrl-] key to turn off case-insensitivity while it does
the jump to tag, then turn it back on again. Now pressing ctrl-] will
jump directly to your property, only presenting menus on the occasion
when the tag you search for is defined in more than one place using
precisely the same name.</p>
<p>Much better.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Also see this post about adding stdlib and venv contents to
your tags:

<p>Some developers find Git takes a little getting used to, claiming that
it is conceptually convoluted compared to other distributed version
control systems. I used to number myself amongst them.</p>
<p>Happily, I've found that a couple of simple spatial analogies have made
me proficient and fluent in using Git's command-line interface.</p>
<p>One of the things that tripped me up as a novice user was the way Git
handles <strong>branches</strong>. Unlike more primitive version control systems, git
repositories are not linear, they support branching, and are thus best
visualised as trees, upon the nodes of which your current commit may add
new leaf nodes. To visualise this, it's simplest to think of the state
of your repository as a point in a high-dimensional 'code-space', in
which branches are represented as n-dimensional membranes, mapping the
spatial loci of successive commits onto the projected manifold of each
cloned repository.</p>
<p><img alt="Branches as n-branes" src="files/2010/12/I1546manifold.png" title="I1546manifold"></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> There is, of course, a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/embdf/git_complicated_of_course_not_commits_map_to/">fabulously insightful
commentary</a>

<p>There's been a lot of
<a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/index.shtml">blather</a> of late
about this supposedly-fiddly conversion process. Personally I've found
that working on the Windows operating system, the transition is a lot
smoother. Simply first install Cygwin, cd to the root of your
repository, and then:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>find . -name .svn -exec rm -fr <span class="o">{}</span> <span class="se">\;</span>
hg init
hg add .
</code></pre>

<p>and you're done. There may be a few <em>nuances</em> this doesn't address, but

<p><em>In which I once again indulge my obscure command-line fetish.</em></p>
<p>I often spend hours of my day cycling through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit code and its unit tests</li>
<li>Save my changes</li>
<li>Push a button or change window focus to explicitly re-run the code's
    unit tests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh frabjous day, the grinding manual labour of the last of these three
steps can now be banished forever, courtesy of <code>rerun</code>, a command line
Python script that re-runs a given command whenever it detects changes
to any of the files in the current directory, or its subdirectories.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: It's Python 2.7, and works great on Windows XP, Macs and
Ubuntu.</p>
<p>For example: I had previously bound f6 in Vim to 'run the current file's
unit tests. Now I've bound shift-f6 to <code>rerun</code> the current file's
unit tests in a new console window. This pops up a new window showing
the test results. I then continue editing in Vim, and whenever I hit
save, the unit tests are re-run in the other window. All the while the
focus stays on my editor. It's really sweet!</p>
<p>Thanks for the original idea goes to to the bash command <code>watch</code>, and an
old (now offline) blog post by Jeff Winkler.</p>

<p><em>This is second in a series of articles about algorithmically generating
geometry to drive OpenGL from Python.</em></p>
<p><a href="posts/flying-high-hobbyist-opengl-from-python"><em>&lt;&lt; Back to part 1</em></a></p>
<p><em>Last time we got as far as creating some instances of our super-simple
Shape class, and having Glyph and Render classes convert those to arrays

<h3><strong>Composite Shapes</strong></h3>
<p>In order to create more complex shapes by composing instances of
existing ones, we need a simple composite shape:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MultiShape</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">children</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">matrices</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">child</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">pos</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">orientation</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">children</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">child</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">matrices</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Matrix</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pos</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">orientation</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre>
<p>A MultiShape contains a list of child Shapes, and a matrix for each
child, indicating the child's position and orientation relative to the
MultiShape's front-and-center.</p>
<p>This is probably as good a point as any to confess that for the purposes
of this demo, I ended up writing my own Matrix class, along with my own
Orientation class. Even my Vec3, which earlier I showed you defined as a
named tuple, gradually started to sprout some methods, until it became a
fully-formed custom vector class. This was pretty silly - it easily
doubled the size of my code-base, and while it felt like rewarding and
productive work, it was actually a waste of time. With hindsight, I
should have predicted this would happen, and started out using an
existing library for things like this, such as Euclid or Numpy. Way it
goes.</p>
<p>Anyhow, if a Multishape is going to be usable wherever a Shape is
currently used, it needs to provide the same interface, which luckily is
very simple - it just needs to provide iterables of vertices, faces and
face_colors. Here is how MultiShape provides a sequence of vertices, by
chaining the vertices of all its children, each vertex transformed by
the matrix of the relevant child shape:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nd">@property</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">vertices</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="n">matrix</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">transform</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">vertex</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">child</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">matrix</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">zip</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">children</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">matrices</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">vertex</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">child</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">vertices</span>
    <span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>There is an inefficiency to this. When MultiShapes are nested, I'm
transforming each vertex once for every branch in the tree. It would be
cheaper to just multiply the matrices of nested MultiShapes, and then
have the top-level MultiShape apply the resulting transforms to the
vertices of each of its children. However, we're only performing this
work at application start-up, not every frame, so I'm choosing to eat it
for the sake of simple-as-possible code.</p>
<p>Similar properties are defined on MultiShape to provide sequences of
face indices and face_colors, by aggregating those of its children.</p>
<p>Using MultiShape, we can now easily compose groups of our basic Shapes.
A new factory function composes a bunch of cubes into the same
MultiShape:</p>

<p>If you look carefully, you can make out some depth-buffer fighting where the
three rings intersect, but I'm moving too fast to worry about that now.</p>
<p><img alt="Tri-axis rings" src="files/2010/07/screen-tri-ring.png"></p>
<p>Because we're drawing each MultiShape using a single iteration of the
Render.draw() loop, we've massively reduced the overhead in drawing each
Shape, so we can easily add all of these at once into the world at
60fps, although it does form a bit of a visual cacophony:</p>
<p><img alt="All the rings, plus some other stuff" src="files/2010/07/screen-all-rings-etc.png"></p>
<p>I wonder how much stuff we can add into a MultiShape before it starts to
affect the framerate? Let's investigate... How about a spherical glob of
red blood cubes:</p>
<p><img alt="A glob of red blood cubes" src="files/2010/08/screen-glob-red-cubes2.png"></p>
<p>It turns out I can get about 14,000 cubes (168,000 triangles)
<a href="posts/flying-high-opengl-from-python-part-2/#update">[1]</a> into a single MultiShape like this before the framerate
starts to drop. I'm still rendering these as regular ctypes arrays, not
OpenGL vertex buffers (I don't think my hardware supports that), so all
the geometry is being sent needlessly over the bus to the GPU every
frame.</p>
<p>How about an alternative, the RgbCubeCluster:</p>

<p>This creates a cluster of cubes, each one colored by its position in RGB
space.</p>
<p><img alt="An RGB cube cluster" src="files/2010/07/screen-rgb-cluster.png"></p>
<p>We still have enough <em>oomph</em> left over to dive the camera right into the
midst of the RgbCubeCluster and reveal that all the previous stuff is
still in the world too:</p>
<p><img alt="Whirling machinery at the center of an RgbCluster" src="files/2010/08/screen-rgbcluster-and-everything.png"></p>
<h3><strong>Recursively Generated Geometry</strong></h3>
<p>Can we make any more interesting recursively-defined geometry? The first
thing I thought of (no doubt this has been done many times before) was
the 3D equivalent of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_curve">Koch curve</a>:
Take a tetrahedron, and for each face, embed a new, smaller tetrahedron
sticking out of it. Recursively repeat this for each of the new smaller
triangles that have been formed.</p>
<p>The first time I coded this, successive iterations literally replaced
every new surface triangle that was formed by the process, with an
arbitrary break after eight or so iterations. I was quite surprised by
the result, which turned out to look like a slightly corrugated cube. At
first I naturally assumed that a bug in my code was the cause, but after
a period of contemplation, I realised this was the correct geometric
result. The reason for it can be seen in this Wikimedia diagram of the
first three iterations of forming a Koch surface:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="files/2010/08/Koch_surface_0_through_3.png"></p>
<p>The first iteration replaces every triangle by sticking a new
tetrahedron out of it - exactly as I had done for every face of my
original. The next iteration sticks smaller tetrahedrons onto every new
surface, and the edges of these new, smaller tetrahedrons all line up
with each other, to form long, contiguous straight seams in the
resulting shape. By the third iteration (the final one shown here) the
end result is becoming apparent. Each successive iteration merely
reduces the size of the ridges - the overall shape of the surface is
unchanged.</p>
<p>I modified my algorithm to only replace the triangular faces of the
newly-formed smaller tetrahedrons, rather than replacing every
triangular surface, and the result is this more pleasing snowflake
shape.</p>
<p><img alt="A Koch tetrahedron" src="files/2010/08/screen-koch-tetra.png"></p>
<p>This algorithm is about 60 lines of code. A similar operation can be
done on a cube, by poking a new, smaller cube out of each of its faces:</p>
<p><img alt="A Koch cube" src="files/2010/08/screen-koch-cube.png"></p>
<p>The deeper red parts are the original cube and the early generations of
children. The lighter yellow parts are the later generations.</p>
<p>The final and best example in this section was supplied by Oscar
Lindberg, who was interested enough on my old blog post about this to
download the code and produce some shapes of his own. Screenshots can't
do it justice, but the full stately geometry becomes wonderfully
apparent when it's in motion. The <em>tetrix</em>, aka the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle">Sierpinski
tetrahedron</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="The tetrix, aka Siepinski Tetrahedron" src="files/2010/08/screen-sierpinski.png"></p>
<h3><strong>Odds and Ends</strong></h3>
<p>That's about all I've got to show you. Overall I'm really pleased by
this, and excited to do some more of the same going forward.</p>
<p>You may have noticed I've cheated a little in the demo / screenshots -
some of them show clear evidence of the rudimentary lighting shader I
added (e.g. topmost faces are slightly lighter in color than other
faces.) It would be simple enough to fake this, by providing slightly
varying colors for each face of our shapes, but for those of you looking
at the code: I didn't do that. Instead, I had Glyph generate arrays of
surface normals, which is done by Glyph.get_glnormals(), which works
pretty much just like all the other Glyph methods we examined in part 1.
I was getting tired of explaining how Glyph worked, so I figured you
were probably getting tired of it too, and wouldn't mind if I skipped a
little which wasn't strictly necessary.</p>
<p>I was initially a little disappointed by the performance at rendering
many independently positioned and oriented objects, but now it's picked
up (see footnote [1]) and is now perfectly acceptable: a little
over 450 separately moving cubes at 60fps. The OpenGL bindings in
PyOpenGL wisely choose to prefer correctness and robustness over
performance by default, so as a result, calling OpenGL from Python is
not fast out of the box. The <a href="http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/documentation/">PyOpenGL
documentation</a> suggests
many ways in which this performance can be regained once your program is
working and debugged. I'm not yet using any of these suggestions, so
hopefully my sluggish performance could be improved substantially.</p>
<p>In addition, Richard Jones suggested that the innermost Render.draw()
loop could possibly benefit from <a href="http://www.cython.org/">Cython</a>
(optional static typing to be added to code written in a less-dynamic
subset of Python.) This would not just improve the general performance
of the code in that loop, by actually compiling it to C, but in doing
so, it would eliminate the Python / C boundary performance penalties,
and this is something I'm excited to try out in the near future.</p>
<p>[1] <strong>Update:</strong> A couple of hours after hitting publish on
this, I discover that switching from the PyOpenGL bindings to those
built into pyglet gives me two to four times the frame rate, for zero
code change except the imports. Clearly I don't understand how to get
the best performance out of PyOpenGL. I've been back and updated the
performance stats in this post, and hope to make another post about this
at some point when I understand what I was doing wrong.</p>

<p><em>This is a transcript-from-memory (what I wish I'd said) of the talk I
just gave at <a href="http://www.europython.eu/">EuroPython</a> 2010, for which I
owe a debt of gratitude to Richard Jones for his last-minute moral
support while wrestling with projectors and refresh rates; and to the

<hr>
<p>With this talk I want to give an overview of creating 3D graphics in
OpenGL from Python. Instead of covering topics already covered by a
thousand OpenGL tutorials, I want to shift attention towards some ideas
of how to generate the input to your renderer - how to algorithmically
create geometry. I'll show that with just a paltry few hundred lines of
relatively simple code, you can generate some interestingly chunky
shapes - virtual sculptures, if you will. Since this talk has the word
<em>hobbyist</em> in the title, I want to emphasise how easy this is, and I
want to have some fun with the pretty pictures.</p>
<p>Out of interest, how many people here are already expert OpenGL users
<em>(a few hands hesitantly go up, then some think about it and go down
again</em>) err, I mean how many have already used OpenGL to do anything at
all <em>(about half the people raise their hand</em>.) Alright, well, I want
you all to leave here enthused to go generate your own images or
animations or games.</p>
<h3><strong>Inspirations</strong></h3>
<p>As the field of computer graphics advances, there's an understandable
tendency for more photorealism, This is laudable, but I also feel that
the effort expended on achieving this technical goal is often undertaken
without considering whether photorealism is the best aesthetic choice
for a particular project.</p>
<p>In the past, games and other applications adopted particular visual
styles out of technical necessity. As is often the case, these
restrictions resulted in a diverse blossoming of creative ideas,
producing an enormous set of distinctive visual styles and experiences.</p>
<p><img alt="Non-photo-realistic Quake" src="files/2010/07/nprquake.jpg"></p>
<p>Crucially, the most successful and memorable examples of these were
projects that found ways to work in harmony with the restrictions of the
medium, rather than attempting to gloss over them.</p>
<p><img alt="Rez HD" src="files/2010/07/RezHDA.jpg"></p>
<p>Advances in computing power and technique provide modern games and
applications with a far wider range of options in how to present
themselves visually, and yet the greater proportion of them seem content
with a conventional and unimaginative 'near-photorealistic' appearance.
This disappoints me, because I feel that projects that opt for a more
highly stylised look, when appropriately chosen, can create a vastly
more striking and memorable artistic experiences. This is true in movies
and all kinds of art.</p>
<p><img alt="Waking Life" src="files/2010/07/wakinglife1.jpg"></p>
<p>As an amateur graphics programmer, I don't have large resources nor much
experience to throw at the problem, so my options and my abilities are
limited. But, like a good artist, I believe it should still be possible
to create things that are both strikingly beautiful and highly
functional, either by working with the restrictions of the medium, or by
finding creative ways to exploit or extend them.</p>
<p><img alt="Love" src="files/2010/07/love.jpg"></p>
<p>In particular, the kind of minimal, clean-lined aesthetic that amateur
OpenGL programs take on by default are useful for their crisp precision,
as charting and visualisation tools. But above that, I love them for
their stark minimalism, their clean lines and homogeneous fields of
colour.</p>
<p><img alt="Tron Legacy" src="files/2010/07/tron.jpg"></p>
<p>I wish more professional game developers had an incentive to aim for
less conventional aesthetics - whether they be deliberately retro, or
else striking out in some new direction of their own. It's that brave
minority of projects which do this which form my inspiration.</p>
<h3><strong>Starting Point</strong></h3>
<p>I'm assuming we already have a minimal OpenGL application, that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opens a window</li>
<li>Provides an OpenGL context for us to render to</li>
<li>Sets appropriate 3D projection matrix</li>
<li>Sets the initial modelview matrix state based on the position and
  orientation of a 'camera' object</li>
<li>Calls our empty 'draw' function once per monitor refresh.</li>
</ul>
<p>This results in a blank screen, at 60fps. Here's a screenshot, so you
can see exactly what it's doing:</p>
<p><img alt="A blank screen" src="files/2010/07/blank1.png"></p>
<p>I'm using pyglet &amp; PyOpenGL for this, but this isn't important. Any
framework that provides the above abilities, such as PyGame, along with
bindings to OpenGL, will be just fine. Whichever framework you use, this
minimal application might take on the order of about 150 lines of code,
and is covered in countless tutorials all over the web.</p>
<p>From here on in I plan to show (or at least describe) pretty much all of
the code that I add on top of this minimal OpenGL loop.</p>
<h3><strong>Goal</strong></h3>
<p>To begin with, I'm going to lead you as quickly as I can through a Shape
class, that model 3D shapes, in a way useful for the creation of
geometry, and then a Glyph class that converts these geometries into
arrays for OpenGL. Finally these arrays get passed into a Render class,
which simply calls glDrawElements to render them.</p>
<p><img alt="Our Goal" src="files/2010/07/fun-stuff.png"></p>
<p>Once the above infrastructure is in place, we can have some fun
generating interesting shapes to make pretty pictures with. The
conventional way to provide geometry to your OpenGL code is by loading
your data from files. Today though, I want to stick with generating
geometry from code, to see where that leads.</p>
<h3><strong>Modelling Polyhedra</strong></h3>
<p>A polyhedron is a 3D shape with flat faces and straight edges. We can
model coloured polyhedra using a simple Shape class:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">Vec3</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">namedtuple</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Vec3'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'x y z'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">Color</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">namedtuple</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Color'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'r g b a'</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Shape</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">vertices</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">faces</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">face_colors</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="c1"># list of Vec3s</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">vertices</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">vertices</span>

        <span class="c1"># list of faces, each face is a list of indices into 'vertices'</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">faces</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">faces</span>

        <span class="c1"># List of colors, one per face</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">face_colors</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">face_colors</span>
</pre>
<p>An instance of this class, for example, might represent a yellow cube,
or a tetrahedron with green and black faces, or any other coloured
polyhedron we can imagine.</p>
<p>To demonstrate how classes Shape, Glyph and Render hang together, let's
examine an even simpler example, a yellow triangle joined to a red
square:</p>
<p><img alt="Red Triangle &amp; Yellow Square" src="files/2010/07/triangle-square.png"></p>
<p>You can see this geometry features five vertices (v0 to v4), which are
used by the two faces. This might be represented by an instance of
Shape:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">v0</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Vec3</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span>  <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">v4</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Vec3</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span>  <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>The integers in the 'faces' member are indices into the vertices list.
So the triangular face, for example, is formed by linking vertices 2, 3
and 4.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 1. Creating a Ctypes Vertex array</strong></h3>
<p>In order to render our Shape, we need to convert it to some ctypes
arrays that OpenGL will eat:</p>
<ul>
<li>glvertices - an array of GLfloats (three for each vertex)</li>
<li>glindices - an array of GLubytes (one for each index of each face)</li>
<li>glcolors - an array of GLubytes (four for each vertex)</li>
</ul>
<p>To generate glvertices, we need to dereference the indices in
Shape.faces, to produce a new list of vertices, rearranged into the
order they are going to be drawn:</p>
<p><img alt="Step 1. Dereference indices" src="files/2010/07/dereference-indices.png"></p>
<p>The most visible aspect of this change is that the vertices are
re-ordered, such that the indices now simply read '0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...'.
However that isn't actually necessary. The important part of this
transformation is that vertices which are re-used are now duplicated in
the vertex list. For example v0 now occurs twice. As a result of this
vertex duplication, one the two instances of '0' in the faces lists now
instead reads '3' (referencing the new second copy of v0).</p>
<p>This duplication of vertices is required, because when v0 is used for
the first time, it is as part of the red triangle, and when it is used
the second time it is as part of the yellow square. The color of the
vertex changes from one occurrence to the next. All the attributes of a
vertex (position, color, texture co-ords, normals, etc) are treated as
an atomic unit, so whenever any attribute changes, as the color is
changing here, the vertex position needs to be redundantly specified
again, so as to create a new unique vertex with its own unique attribute
values. Even if the color of v0 in our example was identical for each
use, we will see later that other vertex attributes such as surface
normals will still differ. Don't sweat trying to eliminate these
redundancies, they are necessary, unless every single attribute of the
re-used vertex (including surface normals) are identical.</p>
<p>The code in Glyph.get_glverts() performs this dereferencing step:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Glyph</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_glverts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">shape</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">num_glverts</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">glverts</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">chain</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">from_iterable</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="n">shape</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">vertices</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="p">]</span>
            <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">face</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">shape</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">faces</span>
            <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">index</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">face</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">ArrayType</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">GLfloat</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">num_glverts</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">ArrayType</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">glverts</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>This uses a generator to produce the vertices in the order that we need
them. 'ArrayType' shows the standard idiom to create a ctypes array - we
take the datatype of the array elements, in this case GLfloat since our
vertex positions consist of three floats, and multiply it by the
required length of the array. This yields a new array type. The final
return statement instantiates this array type using the data supplied by
the glverts generator.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 2. Creating Ctypes Index Arrays</strong></h3>
<p>The second job Glyph has to do is create a ctypes indices array, which
is derived from the Shape's faces. In doing this, it has to break the
Shape's faces down into individual triangles.</p>
<p><img alt="Step 2. Tessellate indices" src="files/2010/07/tessellate-indices.png"></p>
<p>The vertex list is unchanged by this step, and the first face - the
triangle - is also unchanged. The second face, the square, has been
broken into two triangles.</p>
<p>There are well-known algorithms for breaking an arbitrary polygon down
into individual triangles. Using the utility functions found in the GLU
library, this can be done in about 150 lines of Python. But in the
interests of keeping it simple, I decided to restrict our code to just
handling convex faces. Tessellating these faces can be done using a
considerably simpler algorithm:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">tessellate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">face</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">'''</span>
<span class="sd">    Break the given face into triangles.</span>
<span class="sd">    e.g. [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] -&gt;</span>
<span class="sd">    [[0, 1, 2], [0, 2, 3], [0, 3, 4]]</span>
<span class="sd">    Does not work on concave faces.</span>
<span class="sd">    '''</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">face</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">face</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">face</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]]</span>
        <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">xrange</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">face</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>We again use a generator, to simply join up the face's first vertex with
all the other vertices, like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Tessellation of convex faces" src="files/2010/07/tessellation.png"></p>
<p>Now we have our tessellate function, Glyph can now create the glindices
array in much the same way as it generated the glvertices. I wasn't
smart enough to write this as a generator first time around, I presume
it would require more than one generator to do it (anyone?), so I'm
needlessly creating an in-memory copy of the sequence, but it turns out
I need to take its length right afterwards anyway, so what the heck:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Glyph</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_glindices</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">faces</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">glindices</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
        <span class="n">face_offset</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
        <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">face</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">faces</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="n">indices</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">xrange</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">face_offset</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">face_offset</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">face</span><span class="p">))</span>
            <span class="n">glindices</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">extend</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">chain</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">tessellate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">indices</span><span class="p">)))</span>
            <span class="n">face_offset</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">face</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">ArrayType</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">GLubyte</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">glindices</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">ArrayType</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">glindices</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>This is more complex than get_glvertices because it is performing both
of the transformations described in steps 1 and 2. But it's still pretty
straightforward. Note that the type of the index array will have change
from GLubytes to GLushorts (or GLuints) if the number of vertices rises
above 256 (or 65,536.)</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3. Creating Ctypes Color Arrays</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, we need an array of vertex colors. This is the simplest of the
lot, generated by repeating the face_color for each face, once per
vertex:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Glyph</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_glcolors</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">faces</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">face_colors</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">num_glvertices</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">glcolors</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">chain</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">from_iterable</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="n">repeat</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">color</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">face</span><span class="p">))</span>
            <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">face</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">color</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">izip</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">faces</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">face_colors</span><span class="p">)</span>

<h3><strong>First Light</strong></h3>
<p>It's might seem like a teensy bit of a slog to get here, but it hasn't
been more than sixty lines of code, and now we're in a position to pass
our ctypes arrays into OpenGL's drawElements. This happens in our
Render.draw() method:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Render</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>

<p>This is canonical OpenGL render code, so I'm not going to dissect it,
but now we get some actual visible output:</p>
<p><img alt="Red triangle, yellow square" src="files/2010/07/screen-triangle-square.png"></p>
<p>Hooray! \o/ We can move our camera position around, and view this 3D
object from different angles.</p>
<p>There's a minor wrinkle here that I'm glossing over. I've turned on
backface culling, so the triangle and square aren't visible if we view
them from the back. For all our future examples I plan on using closed
polyhedra, so we won't be able to see the 'backs' of the faces - those
will be on the inside of the polyhedron.</p>
<h3><strong>The Fun Stuff</strong></h3>
<p>So now we've got all our infrastructure in place, we can start creating
factory functions to churn out some Shapes. Let's start with something
straightforward, a tetrahedron (triangle-based pyramid):</p>

<p>The six faces are quite evident, but the use of <em>itertools.product</em> to
produce the list of vertices perhaps deserves a bit of exposition. It's
an inspired tip from <a href="http://tzotzioy.blogspot.com/">ÃŽÂ¤ÃŽâ€“ÃŽÂ©ÃŽÂ¤ÃŽâ€“ÃŽâ„¢ÃŽÅ¸ÃŽÂ¥</a>.

<p>So there are the eight vertices of the cube, and that gets us the
following:</p>
<p><img alt="A cube" src="files/2010/07/screen-cube.png"></p>
<p>We can add a few more vertices and faces, to make ourselves a truncated
cube:</p>
<p><img alt="A truncated cube" src="files/2010/07/screen-truncated-cube.png"></p>
<p>Once we've got truncated cubes, we might as well add one last face to
form the entrance:</p>
<p><img alt="A truncated cube with entrance" src="files/2010/07/screen-space-station.png"></p>
<p>There's nothing to stop us adding several of these shapes into the world
at once, but since we haven't yet moved any of them away from the
origin, they just sit there, embedded within one another:</p>
<p><img alt="A cube and tetrahedron interpenetrate" src="files/2010/07/screen-cube-tetra.png"></p>

<h3><strong>Moving objects around</strong></h3>
<p>In our earlier Render.draw() method, we left a 'TODO' comment in place,
to note that we weren't yet handling item positions and orientations.
Here's what Render.draw looks like when we fill that code in:</p>

<p>Again, this is very standard OpenGL usage. To set an item's <em>position</em>
attribute, I'm going to use a bit of code that I already snuck into the
demo without telling you about. It's the code that moves the camera
around in space. A simplified version is here, class Orbit, which will
return a new position each time it gets called. The locus of this
position is an orbit around the origin:</p>

<p>The actual camera uses a slightly longer version I call WobblyOrbit (not
shown), which operates in exactly the same way. Any 'mover' class, i.e.
one that returns a Vec3 position when called, can be used to move the

<p>Similarly, we can spin items using 'spinner' classes, that tweak an
item's orientation as time goes by.</p>
<p>With these all in place, we can now add many Shapes to the world, each
moving and rotating independently:</p>
<p><img alt="Several independantly positioned and oriented shapes" src="files/2010/07/screen-several-shapes.png"></p>
<h3><strong>Next week: Composite Shapes...</strong></h3>
<p>This is all great as far as it goes, but it turns out we have a
performance problem. Adding more than about 450 shapes at once starts to
slow down below 60fps (This is all on my trusty 2005-era Thinkpad T60
laptop.) The bottleneck turns out to be in our Render.draw() loop. Each
of those OpenGL functions are from (wrappers around) the OpenGL C
library, and calling across the Python / C boundary like this incurs a
per-function call overhead. Also, a second looming problem is that
creating more interesting shapes is going to become more onerous and
error-prone, as we create longer and more complex lists of vertices and
faces in our code.</p>
<p>One partial solution to both these problems is to use composite shapes,
in which we can compose many copies of our basic shapes into one single,
more complex shape. This will allow us to use algorithmic means to
produce more fun geometry, and will also help us draw more complex
shapes, composed of many simpler shapes, without requiring several
separate OpenGL function calls for each of the simple shapes.</p>

<p>I've been loving the two days of tutorials preceding the EuroPython
conference. This morning I attended <a href="http://www.mechanicalcat.net/richard/log">Richard
Jones</a>' splendid <em>Introduction
to Game Programming</em>. It was an absolute pleasure to be walked through
the creation of an example game like this, using Python game libraries
like <a href="http://pyglet.org/">pyglet</a> and <a href="http://cocos2d.org/">Cocos</a>, by
someone who really knows what he's doing. Also, it's nice to have
something visible to show after a morning's work:</p>
<p><img alt="My asteroids." src="files/2010/07/intro-to-game-programming.jpg"></p>
<p>(Michael your idea of making engine thrust always visible was exactly what I
needed to help me capture the screenshot.)</p>
<p>The code is based very heavily on samples that Richard provided and
talked us through in great detail, so although I now understand it
pretty thoroughly, I can't take much credit. Excepting, that is, for a
handful of minor tweaks I couldn't resist making along the way, like the
flickery animated engine thrust, that made me gurgle with delight.</p>
<p>For the artwork, I stole the shuttle icon (sssshhhhhh!), added the
engine thrust, and created the asteroids themselves entirely from
scratch in Gimp. They are just rotatable bitmaps, albeit designed in
homage of vector graphics of yore, complete with simulated CRT glow.
Brilliant!</p>
