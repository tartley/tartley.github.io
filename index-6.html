<p>Had a marvellous time at <a href="http://pyconuk.org/index.html">PyCon UK
2007</a>, a conference about the
<a href="http://python.org">Python</a> programming language. In the event everyone
from <a href="http://resolversystems.com">Resolver</a> bar one of our directors
went along. We met loads of great and interesting folks, heard many
excellent talks, and gave a few of our own:
<a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/index.shtml">Michael</a> talked
about <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/ironpython/webide/webide.html">driving Microsoft's natty new Silverlight technology using
IronPython</a>.
Giles talked about his concept of the <em>New Age of the Amateur:
End-user Computing without Tears</em>, and I gave a little talk about
test-driven development for beginners, which can be downloaded here:</p>

<p>As reported on <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20070831145639691">Groklaw - Complaint Filed by CCIA with FTC Re
Fair Use</a>, a
conglomerate of computer, technology and communication companies are
filing suit against major copyright holders such as movie studios,
sports leagues and publishers, to prevent them from continuing the
practice of misleading the public with their threatening copyright
notices. The nitty-gritty of the filing is that notices such as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"WARNING: For private use only. Federal law provides severe civil and
criminal penalties for the unauthorized reproduction, distribution or
exhibition of copyrighted motion pictures and video formats."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>at the start of movies serves to intimidate the public from attempting
the many operations to which they are legally entitled, and even
encouraged, by US Federal laws and equivalents globally.</p>
<p>Time to get on the bandwagon? Anyone else interested in conspicuously
taking photos of the copyright notice on the opening day of some
blockbuster movie, and when they come to eject us from the cinema, find
that we're handcuffed to our front row seats?</p>

    <p>So I'm helping a friend create a small website. Casting around for
lightweight tools, I remember that <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/">an intelligent and influential
blogger</a>, much admired by me, has founded a
software company which produces, amongst other things, <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/CityDesk/">City Desk, a web
site creation tool</a>.</p>
<p>Checking out their website, I am delighted to find there is a
free-to-use version for small projects much like the one I am embarking
on. I download it, install it, and fire it up eagerly. Just about the
last thing I expected to see was this.</p>
<p><img alt="citydesk-error1.png" src="files/2007/08/citydesk-error1.png">\</p>
<p><img alt="citydesk-error2.png" src="files/2007/08/citydesk-error2.png"></p>
<p>Just goes to show, creating software which <em>just works</em> is a tough
problem. If the likes of Joel can't figure it out, what hope do the rest
of us have...?</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> It looks like the problems are due to my Windows user
account being limited privs. I perform installs and the like with
elevated privs, using the brilliant
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/aaron_margosis/archive/2004/07/24/193721.aspx">MakeMeAdmin.cmd</a>.
It looks like running CityDesk for the first time performs some
install-related activities, such as setting up the Platform SDK, which
require admin privs. Once this is done, subsequent runs can be done as a
limited privs user with no problems.</p>

    <p><a href="http://howithappened.com/2007/07/pitmatic.html">Rufus comments</a> on
certain English educational establishments becoming hotbeds of Northern
cultural celebration. I can't argue with the unintentional comedy of the
idea, but at the same time, such moves seem to my mind to be causes for
both celebration - long overdue acknowledgements of the richness of
human experience that shaped countless generations across vast tracts of
this land, and simultaneously a regrettable sign of protectionism,
incited by the relentless erosion of the very culture they intend to
promote.</p>
<p>The London Cockney may also be a thing of the past, but at least they
have been preserved in the minds of the current generation, albeit as
some kind of morbid parody. In contrast, the richness and warmth of
traditional Northern lifestyles is right on the verge of slipping away
silently, if it hasn't already entirely done so. A culture as different
from the South as another country, in everything from their food to
their industry. It may be a culture that is now almost entirely lost to
the inexorable market forces of a wealthier and more powerful neighbour,
but it is a culture that valued human traits which are sorely missed in
this harsh world.</p>
<p>With dialects that as recently as my grandparents' generation were
completely incomprehensible to the rest of the country, dialects that
are as close to ancient tongues as any alive today. A rich and vital
part of this country's history, political struggles, battles fought and
lost, the veritable heartland of the industrial revolution that gave
birth to the modern age - all lost, unappreciated, and almost
unremarked, save for the odd enigmatic reference to whippets and flat
caps.</p>

    <p>Hey. I'm doing some Perl coding on the side. Who knows a good way to
interleave two lists? For example, combining (1, 3 ,5) and (2, 4, 6) to
produce ((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)) ?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's easy, Perl has a built-in zip operator:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="sb">`my @result = (1, 3 ,5) ¥ (2, 4, 6)`</span>
</pre></div>

</blockquote>
<p>Brilliant, thanks. Hang on. What the crap!? Is that really a <em>Yen</em>
symbol in there? You have got to be shitting me. What. The. Crap.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ha! Yeah, I know, its a little weird, but since Perl supports source
code unicode encodings, we thought "why not?" Typographically, it looks
like a little zipper, you see? Geddit?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right. I see that now. Um. So which unicode Yen symbol do I use?</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">¥ U+00A5 YEN SIGN
￥ U+FFE5 FULLWIDTH YEN SIGN
</pre></div>

<p>They both look the same in my browser. In fact, they both just look like
question-marks in many people's browsers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, you can easily tell the difference - one of them simply won't work.
Just try them both out until you find the one that works!!!! :-)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right. Brilliant. And who is responsible for this gem?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, that was Larry. Look, if you don't like it, come to think of it,
it's been renamed recently. The zip operator is now simply spelt 'Z'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, whoever would have predicted that might happen? Guess who gets
their language designer privileges revoked? Morons. Get away from me,
before I get any stupid on me.</p>

<p>That's the new "reimagined" version, Dad. I don't really do much
television, and for 2006, downloads of Battlestar was pretty much the
only exception. It's edgy and well-written, and it leaves me
breathlessly excited, and yes it had that lull on New Caprica about five
episodes in, but then it blossomed again, experimenting with one-off
shows, cool ideas, and great characters that remain emotive and
involving while staying well clear of Dawson's Creek. And what a series
finale! Blowing the whole stack of Cylon sleeper agents all at once, the
awful yawning realisation as they each heard the activation signal in
the back of their minds, all drawn to converge on the same room, what a
headfuck, with the psychedelic nebula backdrops all around, to the
rising strains of <em>All Along the Watchtower</em>, as Apollo discovers
Starbuck is still alive. Hooray! Loved it loved it loved it. 8/10.</p>

<p>Aw, heck, I dunno. It's kinda down to Earth and charming, but also plain
and slow-moving. And sure, that was deliberate, it wanted to tell a
simple, powerful story in the terms of its protagonists, within the
context of rural life. But I couldn't really get into it, despite really
wanting to. Some of the acting was a bit lacking. IMDB informs me that
it's a true story. Fair enough. It's still 4/10.</p>
