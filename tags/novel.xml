&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Kim Stanley Robinson, 2015&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has long been held by fans of science fiction that &lt;em&gt;fantasy&lt;/em&gt; is a lowly
subset of science-fiction, or perhaps a disreputable cousin, one for whom
the normal rules of discernment do not apply. If such unlikely and unrealistic
things as dragons and magic are allowed, the reasoning goes, then the book
cannot be relied upon to deliver any kind of coherent narrative experience,
since the lapsed rule-set now allows for any old &lt;em&gt;ex machina&lt;/em&gt; plot twists to
save the day. A magical "defeat the evil" spell? No problem. A new mythical
creature capable of defeating the previously unassailable one? Why not? All
reason is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's more useful though, is to invert the hierarchy of this received wisdom,
and consider science fiction as a subset of fantasy. Mentioning this in fandom
circles blows mental fuses. Does not compute. But the speculative flights of
science fiction are also fantasies. Just fantasies that a particular type of
person finds especially beguiling, compelling, and believable. To some extent,
I concede that on occasion they are believable because they seem to be a
reasonable extrapolation of our current situation. But no matter how reasonable
your extrapolation seems to be, it's always possible that reality will zig
instead of zag, and even the most humdrum tale of a rocket man's life will
find itself at odds with the unexpected reality of suspended human spaceflight
in the face of spiraling real-world costs. The vision that one is selling is
always, to a greater or lesser extent, a wishful one - a &lt;em&gt;fantasy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This becomes immediately apparent once we stray beyond the confines of low
Earth orbit, to take in the wider scope of science fiction, the vast majority
of which encompasses tales across the galaxy, nay, the universe, including time
travel, teleportation booths, aliens of every color, quantum reality
displacement, and multiversal escapades in which literally everything is
possible. These are very clearly fantasies, and it is intensely curious to me
why this sort of fantasy is considered more "realistic" or "believable" than,
say, flying lizards with fiery breath. Even though the narrative hand-waving
that explains away the former - "It's an alternate &lt;em&gt;universe&lt;/em&gt;, where different
rules apply" - is abundantly adequate to more than completely explain anything
in the fantasy realm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once asked my guru science fiction critic &lt;a href="https://damiengwalter.com/podcast/"&gt;Damien
Walter&lt;/a&gt; what makes people consider some
stories believable, while other are not. He replied with a statement that has
stuck with me ever since: People are willing to invest the effort to provide
the conceptual scaffolding around an idea to make it seem believable (e.g. to
speculate on the mechanism that might allow for a faster-than-light
hyper-drive) &lt;em&gt;when the story fulfills some deeper psychological need for them&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, a story on the same topic as &lt;em&gt;Aurora&lt;/em&gt;, of a generation ship sent to
colonize an Earth-like planet orbiting the nearby star of Tau Ceti, is
(usually) a story about the triumph of modernism. Such stories leverage the
sources of strength in the modern world, science and technology and
&lt;em&gt;colonialism&lt;/em&gt;, and a reader who is invested in a modern world-view will feel
validated and empowered by this type of fantasy. They will be will be willing
to exercise whatever extracurricular creative effort is required on the part of
the reader to make the story believable. Doing so will inspire them with the
feeling that their world all makes sense, is leading to something, so that
their daily grind is a part of the heroic story of how humanity transcends its
planetary origins. This is much more fulfilling than investing any effort
getting on board with the waning powers of superstition that are represented by
the fantasy genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="background:#bb2200; color:white; border-radius: 1em; padding-left: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em; padding-top: 2px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;spoilers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In keeping with this, Aurora's colonists are granted every conceivable boon
that science and industry can supply. A ship fully ten kilometers across,
enclosing twenty four massive biomes, each stuffed full of hills and lakes,
soil and forests, microbes and wildlife. A population of well over a thousand
human beings. Miraculous nanotech fabricators, and megatons of elemental
feedstock to run them. A miraculous acceleration laser, fired from Titan for
decades after departure, allowing the ship to coast up to 0.1c, making the
journey in only seven generations, while retaining enough fuel to decelerate
for arrival. A miraculous magnetic shield protects the ship from catastrophic
collisions with stray particles along the way. A benign AI runs the ship,
amusingly pressed into service as the narrator of the tale, and grows visibly
more sentient, emotionally robust and capable as the years pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And hot damn, they are going to &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; all these things, because in this story,
human interstellar colonization is revealed for the fantasy it really is.
Nothing works out, and the problems encountered are far bigger than anything
the ship's designers planned for. Although the ship does limp into orbit
around the destination planet, soon after that people start dying, major
disagreements emerge which descend into catastrophic riots, and the ship's
society falls apart - when have humans ever invented a reliable form of
governance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a rip-roaring final act, that stretched my credulity, but revives the
stakes and entertainment value in what might otherwise be a relentless downer
of a read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book, and interviews with the author, caused quite a stir in science
fiction circles. People were extremely angry. The book was attacking their
deeply held beliefs that the future of humanity is as a successfull
space-faring species. They had invested their identity in this world-view,
because of how it serviced their psychological needs for fulfillment and
meaning. They had developed a religious conviction around this particular kind
of fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of Aurora is to highlight the idea of human interstellar colonization
as a dangerous distraction from the very real project of taking care of the
long term health of our planet and our society right here on Earth. It is going
to take &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; miraculous levels of technology and resources to start
thinking about interstellar travel. If, by some miracle, we make it to a year
10,000 utopia, with infinite resources and the wisdom to manage them, then
sure, we can worry about interstellar travel. But for now, can we just focus on
some of the very basic problems of existence here on Earth, like how to make
everyone fed and liberated, educated and fulfilled, without killing our planet
to do it? Maybe invent some sort of government that is reliably able to do
that? That would be nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Dhalgren cover" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2023/dhalgren.webp"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Samuel Delaney, 1975&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It broke me. I need to take another run up to this. Advice welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://localhost:8000/categories/did-not-finish/"&gt;&lt;span style="background:grey; color:white; border-radius: 1em; padding-left: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em; padding-top: 2px;"&gt;did-not-finish&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, I did finish it eventually. It took me five months, and three
attempts in the end, along with the reading of countless notes, critiques and
analyses to keep my comprehension and engagement up. For my own sanity, I'm
going to attempt a quick summary of the plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;✻  ✻  ✻&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main character, Kid, is not simply an unreliable narrator, but is actually
amnesiac, and delusional. Or he might be. His sanity remains unknowable.
Certainly he cannot tell right from left, and hence is constantly getting lost.
The city of Bellona's physical environment is deadly unpredictable, laws of
cause and effect no longer apply, time is out of joint, and occasionally the
clouds part to reveal two moons. A sense of chaotic unreality permeates
everything. The social order is gone, as people wander from one encounter to the
next, making friends or enemies or lovers on an hour-by-hour basis. Everyone is
vulnerable to rape and death at the hands of the literally monstrous Scorpion
gangs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kid discovers a notebook, containing unsettling entries which, glimpsed,
are very similar to passages from the novel we are reading. Perhaps it is
an alternate draft? These entries might, or might not be, Kid's own writings.
He is unable to tell, as time loops and memory collapses. Regardless, he
contributes further to the journal, and these entries are presented in duelling
columns, as equal peers to the action, as alternate resolutions, entire
different sequences of events, or metafictional commentary upon what "actually
happened".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kid is drawn into a Scorpion gang, at first reluctantly, but then rising to
prominence amongst them for his crazy, heedless bravery. Mythological portents
contribute to a sense of dread anticipation of a cyclic, apocalyptic frenzy,
which subjectively comes about as Kid's mental condition - or the legibility
of reality - deteriorates towards the novel's end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final words of the duelling channels presented by Kid's notebook end in
mid-sentence, which is completed by the novel's opening, forming the promised
cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;✻  ✻  ✻&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure I'm up to drawing conclusions on top of that without lifting them
wholesale from elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly I must admit that I found it hard work. It's difficult for me to
discern what it is about this text which I found unrewarding, versus, say, books
by David Mitchell like &lt;em&gt;number9dream&lt;/em&gt;, which I loved. Perhaps in number9dream,
I felt like I was in on the joke, because I was able to clearly identify
distinct strands of metafiction and moments of unresolvable ambiguity, wherein
one perspective might shift impossibly into another, but each instance of this
is, with thought, separable from the rest of the novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas &lt;em&gt;Dhalgren&lt;/em&gt; has a denser tapestry of prickly ambiguity. No part or level
of the fiction can be relied upon, from the largest of characterisations of the
main character, to the tiniest of descriptive detail. All is in flux,
misdirecting, unreliable, making a casual reading just confusing, while a
careful reading is the same, but more so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reading around, I discovered that Delaney repeatedly spoke about Dhalgren as
an attempt to convey his experiences living with dyslexia and dysmetria - an
inability to perform co-ordinated bodily movement - together with his time on a
mental ward during a breakdown, and his repeated episodes of seeing destroyed
urban landscapes that nobody else could perceive. Because of this, part of me
feels as though the novel might just be an exercise in confusion. An attempt to
simulate the helplessness of mental illness by undermining all aspects which the
reader might otherwise have felt they could rely on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does, in principle, seem like a worthy experiment - and I'm sure this is
only part of what such a relentless, ambitious work is attempting. But on the
other hand, it makes me think that some of the more positive reactions to
Dhalgren might just be from readers who perceive, in the chaos, a grand
meaningful structure that simply isn't really there. Throw enough noise at a
filter, and the resulting output signal is not a function of the noise on the
input, but is instead characterized entirely by the filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems ironic to me that perhaps the most vehement of the book's many
detractors is Philip K. Dick, who described it as "trash". I would have
said Dhalgren closely resembles the kind of profoundly unsettling departures
from realism that came from Dick channeling his own mental illness. Evidently
I'm wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidently, I'm wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Neuromancer cover" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2022/neuromancer-cover.webp"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by William Gibson, 1984.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So opens William Gibson's debut novel, and it is to his eternal credit that we
all still remember the line now, nearly forty years later. I don't usually do
audiobooks, but I made an exception for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bartender’s smile widened. His ugliness was the stuff of legend. In an
age of affordable beauty, there was something heraldic about his lack of it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the majority of the beloved science fiction of my youth, Gibson's
poetic, literary style has only increased in my estimation over the subsequent
decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of
legitimate operators, in every nation. By children, being taught mathematical
concepts. A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every
computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged
in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city
lights, receding.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consensual hallucination might seem prosaic now, but one has to remember
this was written back when the internet connected less than 1,000 hosts,
accessed via green screen text terminals on university campuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He'd made the classic mistake, the one he'd sworn he'd never make. He stole
from his employers. [...] Of course he was welcome, they told him, welcome
to the money. And he was going to need it. Because — still smiling
— they were going to make sure he never worked again. They damaged his
nervous system with a wartime Russian mycotoxin. Strapped to a bed in a
Memphis hotel, his talent burning out micron by micron, he hallucinated for
thirty hours. The damage was minute, subtle, and utterly effective. For Case,
who lived for the bodiless exultation of cyberspace, it was the Fall. In the
bars he'd frequented as a cowboy hotshot, the elite stance involved a certain
relaxed contempt for the flesh. The body was meat. Case fell into the prison
of his own flesh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He introduced the world to cyberpunk, combining the fatalistic noire of Blade
Runner with the relentless dehumanizing advances of a libertarian tech
dystopia, to create a startlingly original warning of our possible future that
looks, as the decades tumble by, increasingly on-the-nose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A year here and he still dreamed of cyberspace, hope fading nightly. All the
speed he took, all the turns he'd taken and the corners he cut in Night City,
and he'd still see the matrix in his dreams, bright lattices of logic
unfolding across that colourless void... The Sprawl was a long, strange way
home now over the Pacific, and he was no console man, no cyberspace cowboy.
Just another hustler, trying to make it through. But the dreams came on in
the Japanese night like livewire voodoo, and he'd cry for it, cry in his
sleep, and wake alone in the dark, curled in his capsule in some coffin
hotel, hands clawed into the bedslab, temper foam bunched between his
fingers, trying to reach the console that wasn't there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several versions of Neuromancer as an audiobook. The slightly
abridged six-hour version &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/NeuromancerReadByWilliamGibson"&gt;available for free at the Internet
Archive&lt;/a&gt; is notable
for two things: it is read by William Gibson himself, and it is an extremely
low quality rip from an audiocassette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Night City wasn’t there for its inhabitants, but as a deliberately
unsupervised playground for technology itself. Like a deranged experiment in
social Darwinism, designed by a bored researcher who kept one thumb
permanently on the fast-forward button. Biz here was a constant subliminal
hum, and death the accepted punishment for laziness, carelessness, lack of
grace, failure to heed the demands of an intricate protocol.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audio quality might make anyone immediately pass this version by. It isn't
just noisy, but features discernible wow and flutter - artifacts characteristic
of the stretching or uneven speed of its original tape based media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He closed his eyes. Found the ridged face of the power stud. And in the
bloodlit dark behind his eyes, silver phosphenes boiled in from the edge of
space, hypnagogic images jerking past like a film compiled of random frames.
Symbols, figures, faces, a blurred, fragmented mandala of visual information.
Please, he prayed, now- A gray disk, the color of Chiba sky. Now- Disk
beginning to rotate, faster, becoming a sphere of paler gray. Expanding- And
flowed, flowered for him, fluid neon origami trick, the unfolding of
distanceless home, his country, transparent 3D chessboard extending to
infinity. Inner eye opening to the stepped scarlet pyramid of the Eastern
Seaboard Fission Authority burning beyond the green cubes of Mitsubishi Bank
of America, and high and very far away he saw the spiral arms of the military
systems, forever beyond his reach. And somewhere he was laughing, in a
white-painted loft, distant fingers caressing the deck, tears of release
streaking his face.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I'd urge you to stick with it. For the author's reedy, Virginia-inflected
voice has a cadence that holds the attention. A rhythm of tone and emphasis
that, for me, works considerably better than the practiced glossiness of more
recent, more professional recordings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The moment, I mean the nanosecond, that one of those things starts figuring
out ways to make itself smarter, Turing’ll wipe it. Nobody trusts those
fuckers, you know that. Every AI ever built has an electromagnetic shotgun
wired to its forehead."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the second chapter, I'd stopped being bothered by the audio
quality, and by chapter three, it had become an intrinsic part of the
experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was disturbing to think of the Flatline as a construct, a hardwired ROM
cassette replicating a dead man's skills, obsessions, kneejerk responses.&lt;br&gt;
[...]&lt;br&gt;
He slotted some ice, connected the construct, and jacked in.
It was exactly the sensation of someone reading over his shoulder.
He coughed.&lt;br&gt;
  "Dix? McCoy? That you man?' His throat was tight.&lt;br&gt;
"Hey, bro," said a directionless voice.&lt;br&gt;
"It's Case, man. Remember?"&lt;br&gt;
"Miami, joeboy, quick study."&lt;br&gt;
"What's the last thing you remember before I spoke to you, Dix?"&lt;br&gt;
"Nothin'."&lt;br&gt;
"Hang on." He disconnected the construct. The presence was gone. He reconnected it. "Dix? Who am I?"&lt;br&gt;
"You got me hung, Jack. Who the fuck are you?"&lt;br&gt;
"Remember being here, a second ago?"&lt;br&gt;
"No."&lt;br&gt;
"Know how a ROM personality matrix works?"&lt;br&gt;
"Sure, bro, it's a firmware construct."&lt;br&gt;
"So I jack it into the bank I'm using, I can give it sequential, real time memory?"&lt;br&gt;
"Guess so," said the construct.&lt;br&gt;
"Okay, Dix. You &lt;b&gt;are&lt;/b&gt; a ROM construct. Got me?"&lt;br&gt;
"If you say so," said the construct. "Who are you?"&lt;br&gt;
"Case."&lt;br&gt;
"Miami," said the voice, "joeboy, quick study."&lt;br&gt;
"Right. And for starts, Dix, you and me, we're gonna sleaze over to London grid and access a little data. You game for that?"&lt;br&gt;
"You gonna tell me I got a choice, boy?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A distortion so thoroughly appropriate to the underlying material
it was as though Gibson had planned it this way all along, speaking directly to
me via a weak signal, projected through time by the noisy filters of this
obsolete electro-mechanical recording mechanism. The words at once clear and
irrevocably decayed, fuzzy sounding but still stark and unmistakable in their
meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Dixie?"&lt;br&gt;
"Yeah."&lt;br&gt;
"You ever try to crack an AI?"&lt;br&gt;
"Sure. I flatlined. First time. I was larkin', jacked up real high, out by Rio heavy commerce sector. Big biz, multinationals, Government of Brazil lit up like a Christmas tree. Just larkin' around, you know? And then I started picking up on this one cube, maybe three levels higher up. Jacked up there and made a pass."&lt;br&gt;
"What did it look like, the visual?"&lt;br&gt;
"White cube."&lt;br&gt;
"How'd you know it was an AI?"&lt;br&gt;
"How'd I know? Jesus. It was the densest ice I'd ever seen. So what else was it? The military down there don't have any thing like that. Anyway, I jacked out and told my computer to look it up."&lt;br&gt;
"Yeah?"&lt;br&gt;
"It was on the Turing Registry. AI. Frog company owned its Rio mainframe."&lt;br&gt;
Case chewed his lower lip and gazed out across the plateaus of the Eastern Seaboard Fission Authority, into the infinite neuroelectronic void of the matrix. "Tessier-Ashpool, Dixie?"&lt;br&gt;
"Tessier, yeah."&lt;br&gt;
"And you went back?"&lt;br&gt;
"Sure. I was crazy. Figured I'd try to cut it. Hit the first strata and that's all she wrote. My joeboy smelled the skin frying and pulled the trodes off me. Mean shit, that ice."&lt;br&gt;
"And your EEG was flat."&lt;br&gt;
"Well, that's the stuff of legend, ain't it?'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five out of five stars. A riveting performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Carl Sagan, 1985.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put this into my library queue as it's highly regarded in some parts, and I'd
never read it. But at about chapter 2, I started to realize that I actually
have read it, maybe thirty years ago. Not only that, but I'm pretty sure I
actually have a copy somewhere on the shelves here at home. I'm going senile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well, at least it's the sort of senile that gives me quick, pleasant things
to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also this month: &lt;em&gt;The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet&lt;/em&gt; by Becky Chambers.
Once again, I wanted to like this so much. I started reading it twice, spaced
about 18 months apart. But each time, I just couldn't get into it, and
abandoned it about 1/3 in. It is indubitably me, not you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Genevieve Gornichec, 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old Norse mythology only briefly mentions the witch
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angrbo%C3%B0a"&gt;Angrboða&lt;/a&gt;,
as the mother of three "monsters", fathered by the trickster god, Loki. This
book explores her life, explicitly acknowledging her erasure as a woman, and
resolves it, providing her a powerful story, in which she survives men, gods,
and all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another fantastic Suze recommendation. Loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also this month: &lt;em&gt;The Emperess of Salt and Fortune&lt;/em&gt; by Nghi Vo. I wanted to
like this sooo much, and can see so many things about that are wonderful, but
for some reason I just couldn't get in the mood. The problem is indubitably me,
not you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Madeline Miller, 2018.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommended by The Suze, after reading it for one of her book clubs,
and I absolutely loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tells the life story of the mythical Circe of the ancient Greek pantheon.
Daughter of Helios, mightiest of the Titans, Circe is driven from her family by
their capricious cruelty. She puts her meagre supernatural talents to work in
service of witchcraft, amongst mortals. Along the way she meets many well-known
mythological characters, such as Odysseus, and the Cretean Minotaur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the writing style that captivated me. A timeless, elegant style uses
powerful turns of phrase to spin a tale of drama and high passions, soaked
in the psychological resonances so typical of Greek mythology.
This style, along with the setting, reminded me powerfully of another favourite
couple of novels of recent years, Mary Renault's absolutely fabulous &lt;em&gt;The King
Must Die&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Bull From the Sea&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circe is my favorite book of the year so far, beating out even the marvellous
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tartley.com/posts/klara-and-the-sun"&gt;Klara and the Sun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people really like this, but it really isn't for me. The plot
is an eerie recreation of the author's previous (and superior) big hit,
&lt;em&gt;The Martian&lt;/em&gt;, in which an astronaut finds themselves unexpectedly alone on an
ambitious space mission, and has to science the shit out of things (by which we
mean deploy some high-school science trivia, along with a penchant for very
ordinary mental arithmetic) to save the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A badly written, distractingly unconvincing, and ultimately deeply annoying
collision between hard science fiction and hand-wavy nonsense, with no literate
themes, no higher meanings, no lurking Jungian archetypes - no mythology to it
at all. Just a succession of edge-of-the-seat will-he-or-won't-he survive tense
moments... Then: Yay, it worked, he did it! But &lt;em&gt;in space!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not even worth engaging the subjectivity-proof rating system for this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 2/10. I did finish it, but I wish I hadn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I mistakenly
&lt;a href="https://www.tartley.com/posts/termination-shock"&gt;named Neal Stephenson as the author I'd read more of&lt;/a&gt;
than any other. But I was forgetting about being young and inhaling books.
On reflection, that title must surely belong to Larry Niven. As a teenager I
read every last thing he did - or at least everything I could find in my
hometown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point my Mom picked up &lt;em&gt;World Out of Time&lt;/em&gt;, to see what craziness her
son was always buried in, and she concluded over the dinner table that I was
reading it for the sex scenes she'd found. I presumably objected inarticulately
that I was so little interested in Larry Niven's brief nerdy depictions of
space sex that I'd barely even noticed they were there, but I have the
impression she wasn't convinced. But it &lt;em&gt;really was&lt;/em&gt; was his brand of hard
science fiction that I was there for (I protest too much!) - revolving around
ideas rather than character arcs, and the ruthless application of consistent
world-views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In inventing the Ringworld, Niven was inspired by Dyson spheres,
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Maker"&gt;first described by Olaf Stapledon&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140109033551/http://meaningoflife.tv/transcript.php?speaker=dyson"&gt;popularized by Freeman Dyson&lt;/a&gt;.
A full, solid Dyson sphere was, in some regards, inefficient. Dyson postulated
miraculous gravity generators to make the inner surface of the sphere
habitable. But this can be achieved much more feasibly by simply spinning the
structure. However, all the matter inside the sphere, including any atmosphere,
then pools at the equator. Niven observed that the superfluous surface of the
sphere, away from the equator, can then be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vastly reduces the material needed to construct the megastructure.
Given miraculous elemental transmutation, one could easily gather enough
matter by recycling all the planets in a solar system as building material,
even with a 1,000km "wall" along each edge to keep the fringes of the
atmosphere in. Although this yields a much smaller habitable interior surface
area than a full sphere, it's still something like a million times larger than
planet Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aliens themselves weren't quite like any I've read before or since. The
creepy sessile but sentient Grogs. The mysterious Outsiders, information
brokers who are able to answer any question humanity has - if only we could
afford the prices. The warlike, carnivorous Kzinti (picture a species of
vicious, vaguely feline Chewbaccas - surely the inspiration for Wing
Commander's Kilrathi) forever attacking humanity before they were quite ready.
You can't help but almost feel sorry for them. By the times of Ringworld,
representatives such as Speaker to Animals (named for his shameful profession,
interfacing with humans) are sufficiently adapted to working alongside humans
to become formidable allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Niven's greatest alien race was The Pierson's Puppeteers - like an
ostrich with two necks, each topped with a single eye and dexterous mouth,
while the brain resides safely in the body (pictured below, on the cover for
Neutron star). The body plan makes so much sense in action. Mobile eyes mean
they routinely view objects from both sides simultaneously, perfect for
close-up detailed work, using the hand-like mouths. Or, spread the necks wide
for amazing stereoscopic vision when distance estimation matters. And that
gestural laugh - eyes turned inward to briefly gaze into one another, observing
the self, no mirror required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psychology is also exquisite. Herbivores and herd-beasts, the Puppeteers
are inveterate cowards. No human has ever met a sane one - only their more
unstable individuals would venture out alone to run the risks of space travel
and meeting alien species. However, they are very intelligent, more so than
humans, and industrious, and devious. It becomes clear over the course of
the books that Puppeteers have selectively bred the Kzinti into constructive
docility by engineering the many human-kzin wars, and their plans for everyone
else are scarcely less manipulative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, my personal favorite was always the Pak. As alien as could be, and yet
they are us. On humanity's original home-world, long before introduction to
planet Earth, a symbiotic plant grows which young humans find uninteresting,
but in middle-age they develop a compulsion to binge on it. It activates genes
that provoke startling physiological and psychological changes, transforming
the human from a &lt;em&gt;breeder&lt;/em&gt;, into a &lt;em&gt;protector&lt;/em&gt; - stronger, and with large
joints for better leverage, with a tough wrinkled armour-like skin, much
smarter, with a second heart, and ruthlessly dedicated to just one goal -
protecting their own offspring. It is protectors who, it turns out many novels
later, originally built the Ringworld. The absence of the transforming plant,
which won't grow on Earth, means we grow without its benefits, leaving us with
inadequate hearts, joints that fail with age, and an old-aged descent into
feeble bodies and minds. Then, as the story begins, the first known
interstellar spaceship shows up at Earth, piloted by one protector, come to
rescue the failed colony, with a hold full of strange plant roots...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wonders like these, from the novels and short stories set in his Known Space
universe kept me up at night, and shaped the way I thought. Although Niven's
writing had some mildly conservative tendencies, especially when under the
influence of his militaristic writing partner Jerry Pournelle, it is also
permeated with the necessity of a very liberal philosophy of non-judgemental
tolerance of other lifestyles, both alien and human, a philosophy made explicit
in one of &lt;em&gt;Niven's Laws&lt;/em&gt;: "The only universal message in science fiction: There
exist minds that think as well as you do, but differently."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's clear I wasn't the only one spellbound. Niven's ideas have been
influential throughout science fiction culture. Bank's Culture's Orbitals and
the understandably much rarer full Rings are clear descendants, as is the
eponymous megastructure/superweapon of the juggernaut &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; franchise, and
countless other imitators. Niven's meticulous hard-SF approach to fantasy in
&lt;em&gt;The Magic Goes Away&lt;/em&gt;, and in particular his concept of the conservation of
&lt;em&gt;mana&lt;/em&gt;, was an influence on &lt;em&gt;Magic: The Gathering&lt;/em&gt;, as acknowledged in the card
Nevinyrral's Disk (Niven's name backwards), which uses magic to simultaneously
accelerate it's own spin, and to hold itself together, thus rapidly using up
all the mana in an area, rendering further magic unusable. Movies such as
Wall-E throw in sly nods - the Axiom is labelled in a passing graphic as using
a "General Dynamics Type Three Hull", which is a similar size and shape to
Niven's "General Products Number Three Hull".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years I remember toting Niven's various doorstop 500 page novels to one
place or another, such as being forbidden from carrying one into the Houses of
Parliament viewing gallery. All the better that they usually had these crazy
great '70s covers, mostly by artist
&lt;a href="http://www.peterandrewjones.net/iacg.htm"&gt;Peter Andrew Jones&lt;/a&gt;,
from whom you can buy prints of some of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collecting these today by Google image search, I see today that these funky
covers are relatively rare - the vast majority of Niven's sales were of
editions with far less interesting and less skillfully put together covers. So
I think it's appropriate to collect and celebrate them here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="clear: both"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've not even read half of what Niven wrote. By the '90s the crazy covers had
been replaced by more conservative designs, and at the same time I drifted away
to other things. At the time it felt more like Niven was drifting away from me,
evolving in style over the years, losing something hard-to-characterize that
I'd enjoyed, maybe just the rawness of his earlier works. Maybe his style was
diluted through him writing so many books as partnerships, or, as I
increasingly assumed, in an advisory role, lending his name to the cover for
younger, less well-known authors, who did most of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back on it, with 30-or-so year's hindsight, there are also
components of Niven's writing that are lacking, and I was slowly growing out of
it. Hard SF often celebrates the elevation of ideas over characters, and while
there is a value to that, particularly for those readers who are the most
vulnerable to the sensation of wonder, it also needlessly shuns other aspects,
like the emotional impact of character-driven drama or individual psychological
epiphany. A more skilled writer, I now think, would have a broader range of
tools to imbue the story with more emotional resonance and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, while the affair lasted, it was fabulous. Goodreads page counts
indicates it was eleven thousand pages, beating my Neal Stephenson consumption
by a clear thousand pages. Combining that with a very conservative estimate of
the number of times I re-read each one, nearly twenty five thousand pages. What
can I say, I was a teenager, with seemingly endless oceans of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are just his books that I've read. He has many others, especially
many that are more recent than these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Termination Shock cover" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2022/termination-shock-cover.webp"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Neal Stephenson, 2021&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's another 720-page doorstop from the much-beloved author (which is actually
slightly slimmer than his average book, which would be 770 pages). It was
enjoyable, but not life changing. Not as compelling as some of his previous.
Reads a lot like a narrative wrapped around the author's own personal
justifications for pro-active geo-engineering projects. Which, I have to admit,
I was pretty horrified by the idea when I first heard about it - meddling
further with a critical and horrifically complex dynamic system that we don't
undertand, and all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story presents the the scenario of countering the temperature rise caused
by CO2 in the atmosphere by releasing high altitude sulphur dioxide, to reflect
sunlight back into space. This mitigates many of the most prominent effects of
climate change, such as high-temperatures, storms, forest fires, and sea-level
rises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It further presents the idea that it's relatively easy and cheap to do, and
some nation or part thereof that cares the most - e.g. The Netherlands, or
Venice, amongst others, will either take a crack at it, or else will cease to
exist. So we might as well get used to the idea and be prepared for what,
geopolitically, happens after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know if it's simply the story making me increasingly familiar with the
idea, or whether the depiction of the mechanism genuinely quells some of my
worries, in that it seems easy to start at a small scale, monitor the results,
scale up as required, and the fail-safe is that the sulphur should quickly fall
out of the air, allegedly harmlessly, if we realize this was a bad idea. I've
at least tempered my initial harshly negative viewpoint somewhat. So, mission
accomplished, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've probably read more text by Stephenson than any other writer. Hmmm. By

&lt;img alt="Klara and the Sun cover" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2022/klara-and-the-sun-cover.webp"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Kazuo Ishiguro, 2021&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was just wonderful to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="background:#bb2200; color:white; border-radius: 1em; padding-left: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em; padding-top: 2px;"&gt;spoilers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The near-future scenario is revealed in a compellingly minimal way, teased
in minor details. Eventually we piece together an epidemic of children without
siblings, born into a competitive, authoritarian society. Higher-rank parents
are able to purchase artificial friends, to help with the rigors of
socialization. Klara, a newly activated artificial friend, demonstrates a lack
of experience in dealing with human situations, but her efforts are
unstinting, to understand what is going on within the family to whom she is
sold, and do her best for them. Her earnest naivety as a narrator only
serves to magnify the emotional impacts of the story, as her keen but
inexperienced observation conveys everything we need to know about the
dysfunctions of her tragic new family. She describes
herself as feeling emotions, so the story is partly a discussion of what it
means to be concious, to feel, as the humans around her are forced by
circumstance into desperate schemes that expose the self-protective
aspects of their love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all that, though, I'm not sure what to take away from it. Clearly the
author is very skilled. It seems likely that metaphors are at work here. But,
lunk that I am, I'm unable to discern what they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm fairly sure that the "boxes" Klara sometimes relates her perceptions being
divided into are just stylish flair - a reference to the ways in which her
brain works differently from ours, calving off processing into separate
processors, or some-such, which comes to the fore when she is under stress,
or deciphering complex emotions. I don't &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; this strikingly non-literal
aspect is indicative of any deeper symbolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when I fail to pick up on metaphor, it's because religious
allegory is involved. Beyond tales of mere personal transcendence, my brain
just isn't wired that way. I can see that Klara is in many ways an innocent.
Free not only of wrongdoing, but also of wishing harm, and - being made, not
born - of original sin. On the literal level, this is emotionally
resonant, especially when Klara's heroic contribution to the family is
rewarded by being uncomplainingly discarded, like an appliance, at the end of
the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is this related to the other big clue about things I'm not picking up on -
the title? I'm at a loss of what to make about Klara's relationship with the
sun, which is a central plot point. Was Klara's bargain with her Sun god
literally answered by a special burst of healing light, that saved her family's
child from terminal illness? Certainly that is how Klara relates it. Could she
perhaps have been imagining this? Might the recovery have been fated to happen
anyway, and Klara's association with the burst of sunlight was all in her head?
But the text tells us that the rest of the household are awestruck by the
brilliance and beauty of that particular sunbeam, not just Klara. Later on, the
questions Rick asks of Klara show that, although he does not understand, he has
guessed the significance of the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. Klara the innocent's anthropomorphized Sun god's healing powers are real,
and He answers her prayers to save the life of a child. And I don't know what
to make of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I'm in good company. A quick search does yield intelligent writing
about the book, but I don't see anyone coming up with aspects or metaphors
that I've entirely overlooked - although that is usually quite fruitful when I
search about other books that puzzle me. So I venture that I'm not the only one
who doesn't get it.&lt;/p&gt;
