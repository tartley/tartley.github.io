Looking Glass's seminal 1998 PC game &lt;em&gt;Thief: The Dark Project&lt;/em&gt; spawned an active and long-lived
modding community, who created hundreds of fan-made extra levels, many of which are extremely artful
and creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group of particularly obsessed loons spent seven years crafting an extraordinary set of such
levels, forming an entirely new single-player campaign for the game, named &lt;em&gt;The Black Parade&lt;/em&gt;. This
was released last year and I only just became aware of it. I'm four missions in, absolutely loving
it, and completely lost in the catacombs beneath the pseudo-medieval city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, my lovingly hand-drawn map of mission 4, Death's Dominion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="background:#bb2200; color:white; border-radius: 1em; padding-left: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em; padding-top: 2px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;spoilers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

and now have at least a rudimentary scenario: Garrett the thief is
taking an opportunistic foray into the local Shope of Curiosities,
having heard that their prize exhibit, the McGuffin of Antioc, has been
removed from its high-security public display, in order to be cleaned or
maintained somewhere on-site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of this, I've been refining the layout of the museum building,
starting with the two-storey entrance hall, complete with a balcony
running round it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="sketch of museum's two-storey main entrance hall" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2010/02/w02-sketch-entrance.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, I've been planning the possible routes a thief might take to get
from one room to another. Generally, the conventional paths - in through
the main entrance and up the stairs and down the corridor - will be
blocked by guards. So the player has to clamber up the outside of the
building, explore the roof, dangle from a rope, pick a lock, find a key
in the janitor's quarters, which opens all the windows, and ledges
outside a couple of windows lead somewhere interesting, etc. I don't
want it to turn into a key fetch quest, but at the same time, I don't
want the player to be able to simply waltz all through the whole
building. I've tried to engineer a single interesting primary route
through the building, with the possibility of a few minor variations so
players feel like they can exercise some freedom and decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="sketch of ground floor" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2010/02/w02-sketch-ground-floor.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having done all that, I'm now quite happy that my plans are sufficient
to produce a small but adequate level. I'll aim to get that complete,
and any fancy window dressing I can layer on top will be a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I completed the modelling of all the rooms in the building, and
doorframes inbetween them. I applied some quick floorboard textures to
differentiate the floors and ceilings from the walls. Here you can see
the view from the main entrance, looking into the two-storey entrance
hall, with the balcony around it visible up on the next level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="main entraince with floorboards" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2010/02/w02-main-entrance.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the view while approaching the top of the stairs, looking down over
the balcony. There will be a railing when it's done:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Approaching the top of the stairs" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2010/02/w02-top-of-stairs-balcony.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks heaps to Qolelis for a comment with a tip about textures on
stairways, to rotate the texture 90 degrees on each stair's vertical
rise. I only just saw that, but will definitely apply it this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: I feel a bit self-concious that I'm creating the bare
minimum that could qualify to be a Thief level. There is not yet a
lively, engaging backstory to the level, complete with colorful
characters, cleverly intertwined with the canon of the original game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the mechanical contents of my level are as simple as
possible. I haven't stretched myself, thinking of imaginative locations
or motives for Garrett to explore. I do not plan to have any clever
special objects or custom scripting in my level, defining dramatic
changing mission objectives as the player reveals new information. It's
a very straightforward 'get into a building, steal the loot, and get
out'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partly this is very deliberate - I want the level to be as minimal as it
can possibly be, so as keep it achievable. But also, this is partly in
response to my feeling that being creative is hard, especially when
under pressure. Right now I feel as though I have enough to worry about
just getting to grips with the minutia of the level editor. I almost
feel as if I need to become comfortable with that before I can relax
enough to get creative with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't entirely unexpected. Clearly one cannot do great work on
one's first attempt. But at the same time, I don't want to just 'give
up' on the creative aspects. I want to do as good a job as I can do,
under the constraints of a small, straightforward 'first time' level
done in a reasonable timeframe. So maybe I just need to keep iterating.
Embelish the dramatic backstory little by little, see what occurs to me
as I go on. Look for some flash of inspiration as I bury myself in the
process. Fair enough. Baby steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2:&lt;/strong&gt; I created a quick TODO list, as a first approximation of
how much work there is to be done. I ended up with a list of 67
mandatory items (eg. Add doors inside each door frame; First pass at
lighting; Add balcony railing.) In addition I have 18 optional items
(eg. Add carpets and rugs; Hide moss arrows in the garden; Entrance hall
main exhibit.) The screenshots above represent about six completed items
(eg. Dromed tutorials; first floor rooms; doorways and arches between
rooms; staircase.) So at the current rate, it's roughly 28 weeks of
work, which is double or triple what I'd planned on. Hopefully my rate
of completing items will increase substantially as I get into the
groove. I'll have to monitor this going forward, and slash scope if I
can't drastically accelerate.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>gamedev</category><category>geek</category><category>pc</category><category>thief</category><category>videogame</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/thief-level-week-2/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2010 19:20:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Creating a Level for Thief 2</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/creating-a-level-for-thief-2/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.tartley.com/posts/sinister-redux"&gt;Sinister Ducks&lt;/a&gt;, my &lt;a href="http://www.gamedevlessons.com/"&gt;videogame
creation mentor&lt;/a&gt; suggested that I create
a mod for an existing game, in order to distance myself a little from
the programming aspects of creating a game, and instead spend a little
time considering the gameplay and the art and the music from the
perspective of the user. Sounds like useful advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the last couple of weeks I've been working through the
&lt;a href="http://www.jasonotto.net/tutorials/CompleteTut.htm"&gt;tutorials&lt;/a&gt; for
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DromEd"&gt;DromEd&lt;/a&gt;, the notoriously cranky
level editor for vintage sneak-em-up &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thief:_The_Dark_Project"&gt;Thief: The Dark
Project&lt;/a&gt;.
(Specifically for the sequel, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thief_II:_The_Metal_Age"&gt;Thief 2: The Metal
Age&lt;/a&gt;, which has a
slightly improved engine and editor.) I chose this for three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Released in 1998, &lt;em&gt;Thief&lt;/em&gt; is old enough that the assets are simple
    &lt;a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/thief-ii-the-metal-age/screenshots/gameShotId,7666/"&gt;low-fidelity geometry and
    bitmaps&lt;/a&gt;.
    These are easy enough for me to create and edit, plus if I
    intersperse existing game assets with my own shoddy creations, there
    won't be a tremendously jarring disparity in apparent quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even though &lt;em&gt;Thief&lt;/em&gt; is ten years old and the company that created it
    long gone, there's still &lt;a href="http://www.ttlg.com/"&gt;a thriving
    community&lt;/a&gt; of amateur afficionados, churning
    out &lt;a href="http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?p=1508201"&gt;new
    missions&lt;/a&gt; at
    the rate of several per month, many of which are of exceedingly high
    quality - in some cases exceeding that of the original game. I'll be
    in good company, will have some meaningful feedback, and will have
    forums to turn to when I get into difficulties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last but not least, &lt;em&gt;Thief&lt;/em&gt; is one of my favourite games of all
    time. The emphasis on sneaking around and avoiding confrontation
    suits my sensibilities. Your protagonist, Garrett, is a marvellous,
    mercenary character. Best of all, in &lt;em&gt;Thief 1&lt;/em&gt;, it reveals
    unexpected depth halfway through - the player's expectations of a
    succession of simple heists takes a strange twist when the powerful
    storyline reveals itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having finished the tutorials, this weekend I broke ground on creating
my own level, or 'fan-mission' (FM), in the parlance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Designing a Thief2 Level in DromEd" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2010/01/dromed-sm.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm using the DromEd Toolkit, which is DromEd with some third-party
patches and bugfixes applied to it. My first impressions with DromEd are
that it's very clunky and ugly, and startlingly lacking in
documentation. I've taken to dipping into the configuration files to see
what keyboard commands exist to experiment with. There are a bewildering
variety of binary patches to modify the executable in various exciting
ways, and forum posts about it, although helpful and prolific, seem
fragmentary and rife with broken links. I've still no idea whether I
ought to be using &lt;em&gt;Dromed Delux&lt;/em&gt; instead, nor where I should get that
from. It's a glorious chaotic riot, and it's a little intimidating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, having said that, the binary patches have all worked fine for me,
and the more I use the editor, the more it's starting to grow on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm setting my FM in a museum. There's already an existing museum
mission out there, but as opposed to its marble-halled austerity, I'm
imagining this will be more like the cramped, cosy, wood-panneled
chaotic collection of something like the wonderful &lt;a href="http://www.britishtours.com/360/soane-museum.html"&gt;Sir John Soane's
Museum&lt;/a&gt; in London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So progress as of week 1 looks like this: I've carved out some very
basic geometry to form a stocky museum building. Here you can just about
make out a hole in the brick facade that will form the front entrance.
This is not the entrance that the player will likely be using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2010/01/front-entrance.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all very crude thus far - with repeating textures on large
surfaces, and plain uniform lighting. There are a complete set of mostly
rectangular ground-floor rooms, with interconnecting doorways. The
highlight of my modelling to date is this stairway leading up to the
(otherwise nonexistant) next floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2010/01/stairway.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not so happy with the wood texture I chose - I'll go back and look
for something more uniform. But I am happy with the way the stairs flair
out at the bottom. I realised in the process of creating this that this
makes it possible to fit a flight of stairs into a smaller space than
would otherwise be possible, by allowing the bottom few steps to
gracefully project out into the corridor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having finished this last night, I then dreamed about geometric
operations on three dimensional spaces, which I think is a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>creative</category><category>gamedev</category><category>geek</category><category>pc</category><category>thief</category><category>videogame</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/creating-a-level-for-thief-2/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jan 2010 19:50:26 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
