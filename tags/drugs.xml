&lt;p&gt;Mush your dog sled across cruel Arctic wastelands, driven onwards by a brisk and intense companion, who hired you to take him back to some remote spot, where it becomes apparent he had some sort of revelation, or maybe a breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The low-res, dithered presentation conveys the harsh, blinding conditions, as you struggle to make out details through the relentless wind and ice. The days and nights of the journey blur into one another, leaving you only fragmentary, disjointed memories:
sledding across the ice;
arriving at crude wooden huts for the night;
mounting the sled before dawn;
collapsing into rough bunks; 
righting the sled while your companion curses you for a fool;
silent moments alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smash cuts amongst snowy wastes echo &lt;a href="https://readcomic.me/comic/nemo-heart-of-ice/issue-full/31"&gt;the discontinuities in Alan Moore's "&lt;em&gt;Nemo: Heart of Ice&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/a&gt;, albeit this is a far more understated tale. The sense is of a protracted, exhausting time spent covering the distance, through punishing conditions, and it's surprisingly evocative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrative leans into the disorientation, making nothing clear. Your companion becomes increasingly cryptic. He urges you onward, never pausing more than absolutely necessary. The deer behave increasingly strangely. Your companion regales you with sickening tales of the investigative mistreatment he subjected them to on his previous visit. By the time the strange mushrooms come into play it is very obvious that you are in a place to which you should never have come, very far from anywhere or anyone, with mounting dread, alone with with a madman. What happened the last time he took this route? What did he leave behind here? What awaits at your journey's end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to know whether the difficulty of interpretation, or the non-literal aspects of your journey, are intended as the result of your character's mushroom-induced fever, or the pretensions of intrusively figurative allusions. Most likely, it seems to be both. The deliberate ambiguity runs deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn't outstay its welcome, all done in an hour. But the memories remain.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>completed</category><category>drugs</category><category>geek</category><category>media</category><category>pc</category><category>videogame</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/that-which-gave-chase/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 21:56:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Infra</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/infra/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2024/infra.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Released in 2016, played by me on Linux in 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much to love about this game. My enjoyment was perhaps stoked by my initial
expectation that such a humdrum, non-mainstream game idea - of a civil engineer
performing building inspections, documenting elements such as cracks and exposed
rebar - must surely be a modest indie offering. But that expectation was vastly
exceeded by the overwhelming generosity of the included content, providing level
after level after level, all rich in geometry and atmosphere, navigable pathways
surrounded by loads of non-essential scene setting, from broom cupboards to
passing container ships, replete with specially coded set-pieces, and a story
that expands in scope beyond all possible initial expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is filled with puzzles that are grounded in the atmospheric setting, having
me clamber under cobweb-strewn desks with a flashlight, looking for tripped
circuit breakers. The setting itself builds beautifully, starting with my
inspection of bridges and decrepit sawmills as I wander along a small overgrown
river path, but increasing in scope and severity as we continue downstream into
town, culminating in varied and ambitious city facilities, from water treatment
plants, abandoned sprawling secret WWI facilities, and various types of railway
and power stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The puzzle difficulty is perfectly judged, demanding about the limit of effort I
could bring to bear, and only on one or two occasions did I give up and find
solutions online, leading overall to a tremendous sense of accomplishment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storyline exposes longstanding secretive corruption in the city, explaining
both the pervasive neglect and sabotage that your inspections reveal, and it
provides a variety of creative reasons why the buildings on your route are
either long-abandoned, or else hastily evacuated moments before your arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives you gloriously free reign over the facilities you pass through,
opening up possibilities to perform ad-hoc repairs as you go. In particular, I
particularly loved the way a successful navigation of levels like the water
treatment plant requires the player to cross reference wall charts showing how
the plant operates, with computer schematics showing the state of various
machinery and valves, and overlay on top of that an understanding of a few signs
and hand-written notes left behind by operators, to remind themselves about
proper operating procedures, broken equipment, workarounds, and switches that
were wired up backwards. And once you figure out this abstract understanding of
what needs to be done, you have to map it all onto the actual 3D spatial layout
of the massive hardware all around you, which often spans multiple buildings.
Just delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should probably also mention the penultimate level, which is one of the most
ambitious of many bold experiments that keep the levels diverse and surprising,
by straying away from the core conceit. In this case that means navigating the
locked-down hallways of an alternative, mushroom obsessed commune, squatting in
a depressing tower block surrounded by trash. While this level is laudable for
being the boldest of these experiments, and represents an important pillar of
the narrative, an alternate society dropping out from the dysfunction induced in
the city by the main story line. However, it didn't quite land for me, and I
soon consulted an online walkthrough, without which I think I would have been
trudging its grimy corridors for a long and dispiriting time. As it was, in
contrast to the entire rest of the game, I was pleased to get it done as quickly
as possible and move on without getting into its optional exploration and
side-quests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But other than that one level, I &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; this game, and played it with a passion
and obsession that burned fiercely for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>completed</category><category>drugs</category><category>geek</category><category>media</category><category>pc</category><category>videogame</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/infra/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Aug 2022 20:43:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Infinite Jest</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/infinite-jest/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float: left"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Inifinite Jest" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2009/02/infinitejest.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by David Foster Wallace (1996)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had such a diverse set of reactions to this, and how could I not?
The writing is bold and idiosyncratic throughout. The novel's story is
not presented in chronological order, and the timeline is obfuscated by
the gleeful adoption of 'subsidised time', in which traditional numeric
monikers denoting each calender year are replaced by the sponsored
labels designated by major corporations - 'Year of the Whopper', and so
on - a marvellous concept which nevertheless makes it completely and
artificially impossible to tell what the hell's going on until about 500
pages in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole novel unashamedly celebrates the author's literary and formal
grammatical credentials - from the extraordinarily-crafted opening
scene, where a tragically misunderstood literary genius disastrously
fails a university entrance interview, with just a hint of a
semi-autobiographical air about him. Scenes of superlative execution are
interspersed with a narrative that is, on the whole, told in the third
person but in the argot of the currently eminent protagonist, leading to
large swathes of the book which are, like, more than conversational in
their familiarity. The combination gives rise to a relentlessly
inventive stream of neology and malapropism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the book resoundingly makes many insightful points by the conclusion, the
story which serves as a vehicle for their delivery is, a collision of ideas,
introducing entirely new and unexplored premises at the 11th hour, which
peter out, ignored and unresolved, by the final page. The jest continues
on, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insidious footnotes for which Wallace's writings are well-known do
not serve to streamline the prose by separating out incidental
annotations, but instead seem specifically employed to elevate the
reader's awareness of the footnotes themselves. Including them in the
main body of the text would allow for the possibility of a busy reader
failing to give each pithy addendum it's full, weighty consideration.
Wallace cunningly obviates this possibility, by discreetly giving pause
to any reader assiduously trying to do their best with a challenging
book, requiring them to invoke the titillating ritual of thumbing
forward a literal thousand pages or so, giving an involuntary moment of
rest in the narrative in which the reader may properly anticipate the
mysterious text to be revealed while they dereference the footnote's
numeric identifier, and then a second pause afterwards to properly
digest and appreciate, while they thumb a literal thousand pages back
again to find where they left off. Three hundred and eighty eight times,
no less. Plus sub-footnotes, obviously. Some of these are pages-long
tomes of critically insightful dialog between major characters. Many
others are completely irrelevant technical specifications. I have to
ask, what the fuck is going on here? Does this really make the novel
somehow better? While I laughed and cried about the content of many of
the footnotes, I remain unconvinced by the mechanism of their delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rant about these aspects of style because these are definitely the
first impressions any reader will have. Getting into the book &lt;a href="http://kottke.org/09/03/growing-sentences-with-david-foster-wallace"&gt;does
require a little
work&lt;/a&gt;.
But fortunately Wallace more than provides the incentive to do so. The
book ranges over many areas, but is mostly about addiction, in its many
forms, and its relationship to freedom of will and to happiness. These
are deep and interesting topics, and are unflinchingly explored with a
very keen eye. For every one of the annoyances mentioned above, the book
provides powerful rewards for those who stick it out. The
heart-wrenching depictions of people going through the utter destruction
of their humanity are as touching and insightful as anything I have
read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some problems or tasks in life which are small enough that an
individual can overcome them by force of will, grinding down the problem
until it is flattened and overcome. This approach fails, however, when
the problem is too large or too hard. Some problems cannot be crushed by
any individual. To navigate past them requires that, instead of trying
to demolish the problem, the individual must instead mould themselves to
fit around the problem's existing contours. People emerge on the other
side of these experiences triumphant but sober - having been changed to
their core by the experience. I consider &lt;em&gt;Infinite Jest&lt;/em&gt; to belong to
this latter class of experience. From the base-camp of its 981 pages
(plus 98 of footnotes), it is intimidating and uncompromising. You love
it and hate it in equal measure, and it makes no attempt to pander to
the former. But as I ploughed on, through it, week after week after
week, I grew to enjoy it more and more and more. I began to see
reminders of it everywhere I looked. I spotted echoes of its style in
the speech of friends who are fans of Wallace. It began, very subtly, to
infect my own speech and writing. The topics it covered touched me to
the core, changing my outlook on deep issues such as religion. By the
time I reached the very last page I emerged, bruised and weary, but also
tremendously excited - I actually flipped it right back and re-read the
first few chapters all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for perhaps the greatest test to date of my supposedly
subjectivity-proof rating system. Here goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/10: If you are ready for a challenge, that entertains and wrenches in
equal measure, stretching you, changing your definitions, taking you on
a tour of regions you never knew existed. It will make you laugh and it
will make you cry. It will leave you a different person than when you
began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0/10: If you can't be bothered.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>book</category><category>drugs</category><category>fiction</category><category>media</category><category>mental-health</category><category>novel</category><category>wallace</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/infinite-jest/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 28 Mar 2009 21:26:49 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Doors of Perception</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/the-doors-of-perception/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float: left"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2008/11/doors-of-perception.jpg" title="doors-of-perception"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Aldus Huxley, 1954&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"...the draperies are living hieroglyphs that stand in some peculiarly
expressive way for the unfathomable mystery of pure being. More even
than the chair, though less perhaps than those wholly supernatural
flowers, the folds of my gray flannel trousers were charged with
'is-ness.'"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fairly standard trip report then, albeit one from a relatively astute
and articulate 1950s traveller. Presumably this will therefore be exactly as
fascinating or tedious as the prospect of such a thing leads you to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I forgot to mention the amusing trivia that this is the
essay &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_doors"&gt;Jim Morrison's band&lt;/a&gt; was
named after. Did everyone know this except me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating 6/10 : No truer nor more deeply insightful word has ever been
written in the English language. Yawn.&lt;/p&gt;
