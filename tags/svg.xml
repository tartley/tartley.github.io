got home and showed the kiddo how to draw an SVG tree with recursive functions
in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first the generated shape looked kinda lumpy and uninspiring, but it did
demonstrate the principle. We were thinking of calling it a day, but I did a
little bit of tweaking on parameters to control how each branch differs in
length and direction from its parent. Suddenly, the generated shape really came
alive, and started to look a lot more like the trees we'd seen on our hike that
afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Silhouette of tree against a blue sky, drawn by a Python program" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2025/tree-art.lossy.webp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image uses a recursion depth of 18, yielding 2^18 twigs, i.e. 250,000,
which generates a 100MB SVG file. This takes about ten seconds to generate, and
another ten to display in an SVG viewer. Alternatively, I can convert the SVG to
a lossy webp, as displayed here, which is only 280kB and displays instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pushing the generation to greater recursion depth makes my SVG viewer and
conversion tools start to stutter and barf. Presumably I could be smarter about
the SVG I generate -- maybe generating the outline of the tree as points on
fewer, more complex polygons, instead of a polygon for each branch segment? No
matter, the artifact is the thing here, and it's done now.&lt;/p&gt;
