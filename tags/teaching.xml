&lt;p&gt;Code in Place 2025 has ended. I participated as a Section Leader, tutoring a small group of beginner programmers through learning basic coding in Python. We covered fundamental programming - variables and loops and conditionals and data-structures, and used them to cajole small on-screen robots into moving around and performing tasks, and to draw some graphics with lines and filled shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course was open to all, so there were many self-driven members of the public, as well as students looking for credit. These were not computer science CS106A students, but instead were studying something else and wanted to add a little bit of programming as an extra skill on the side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about Code in Place is that it aims to investigate &lt;em&gt;scaling&lt;/em&gt; the teaching experience, not only by making the course available to 40,000 members of the public, but by recruiting 4,000 teaching volunteers to act as Section Leaders, guiding the students through the material. The application for section leader involved some basic competency questions, and an interesting task to record a video of me teaching some basic programming concepts. This all helped me to understand that I need to scale down my expectations of what is "self-evident", reminding me that beginners need to be taught &lt;em&gt;from the beginning&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the classes started, I heard complaints in the teachers' forums that other classes suffered from chronic absenteeism, or from students simply not doing the work. But my students were absolutely fabulous, reliably showing up on time, doing all the exercises, and engaging honestly and curiously in the classes. I think that students were sorted into age groups that tend to be not too dissimilar to their Section Leader, so perhaps I had an older-than-average cohort, which might partly explain how I got so lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how it happened, it was a rewarding experience, seeing people rapidly grow their abilities, and become confident where they had originally been fearful. I'm already looking forward to next year's course!&lt;/p&gt;
