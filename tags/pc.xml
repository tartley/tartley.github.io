&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Released in 2024 by Suspicious Developments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was toying with the idea of advancing the kiddo's videogaming curriculum into
a turn-based tactics phase, maybe starting with the genius of 1994's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFO%3A_Enemy_Unknown"&gt;UFO:Enemy
Unknown&lt;/a&gt;, on which I spent
endlessly fascinated evenings of my youth, or maybe one of the better of its
numerous sequels and offshoots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow I was distracted from that plan by multiple people enthusing about last
year's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_Breach_Wizards"&gt;Tactical Breach
Wizards&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm so glad
that I was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; a lovely, synergistic blend of gameplay mechanics, setting,
characters, story, plot-twists and whip-smart dialog, making substantial
improvements on the traditional bombastic and yet intensely thoughtful
turn-based formula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it defuses the self-righteous seriousness of the genre's customary tone
by replacing the gurning muscle-bound military types with a bunch of special-ops
&lt;em&gt;wizards&lt;/em&gt;. Still formidably competent, but now replete with pointy hats,
hazardous runes, and bejeweled wands protruding from their assault rifle
barrels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, while presenting a thrilling facade of enemies dispatched in a dizzying
flurry of rapid-fire magic, the game explicitly disavows wanton killing. While
one of our characters does sneer at the stance, your team is revealed early-on
to use only nonlethal take-downs. This is soon followed up by a cut-scene which
shows your team leaving a building after a mission, revealing the enemies you
earlier dispatched out of eighth floor windows floating gently earthwards, each
safely cocooned in a magical bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, a fundamental mechanic bestows one of your characters with the gift
of magical foresight, allowing you to see the outcome of planned actions before
you actually commit to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a slick narrative integration of a mechanic that serves multiple purposes.
Preventing the anguish of losing a character due to dumb bad luck means the
player is freed up to experiment more, trying audacious plans rather than
playing it safe. Then, when it all goes wrong, you can rewind just a smidgeon,
and try out nearby alternatives, until you have it all &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; right, bouncing
generative combos back and forth between characters, unleashing staggering waves
of action, discovering gleefully that a level you initially thought to be an
impossible slog is actually completable in a single turn. When combined with the
inventive diversity of each character's specific talents, it simultaneously
presents real challenges, while allowing the construction of surprising
solutions that leave one feeling feeling incredibly clever and creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not often worthwhile dwelling on the characters in a videogame, but here
they are the stars of the show. Distinctive, flawed and intensely likeable each
in their own way, with personalities and back-stories that resonate so
pleasingly with their in-game abilities. The writing is just top notch, with
phenomenal dialog, giving the group as a whole a fresh, wholesome and real-talk
vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an all-time classic in my book, and has been fabulous to experience
alongside the 13 year-old kiddo, as we've each run parallel games through to
completion, ogling over each other's shoulders to get sneak previews of
encounters we haven't seen yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>completed</category><category>geek</category><category>media</category><category>pc</category><category>videogame</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/tactical-breach-wizards/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 21:43:45 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Black Parade: Level 04: Death's Dominion</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/the-black-parade-level-04-deaths-dominion/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;So. Looking Glass's seminal 1998 PC game &lt;em&gt;Thief: The Dark Project&lt;/em&gt; spawned an active and long-lived
modding community, who created hundreds of fan-made extra levels, many of which are extremely artful
and creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group of particularly obsessed loons spent seven years crafting an extraordinary set of such
levels, forming an entirely new single-player campaign for the game, named &lt;em&gt;The Black Parade&lt;/em&gt;. This
was released last year and I only just became aware of it. I'm four missions in, absolutely loving
it, and completely lost in the catacombs beneath the pseudo-medieval city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, my lovingly hand-drawn map of mission 4, Death's Dominion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Released in 2023, played on Linux in 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="background:#bb2200; color:white; border-radius: 1em; padding-left: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em; padding-top: 2px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;spoilers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mush your dog sled across cruel Arctic wastelands, driven onwards by a brisk and intense companion, who hired you to take him back to some remote spot, where it becomes apparent he had some sort of revelation, or maybe a breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The low-res, dithered presentation conveys the harsh, blinding conditions, as you struggle to make out details through the relentless wind and ice. The days and nights of the journey blur into one another, leaving you only fragmentary, disjointed memories:
sledding across the ice;
arriving at crude wooden huts for the night;
mounting the sled before dawn;
collapsing into rough bunks; 
righting the sled while your companion curses you for a fool;
silent moments alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smash cuts amongst snowy wastes echo &lt;a href="https://readcomic.me/comic/nemo-heart-of-ice/issue-full/31"&gt;the discontinuities in Alan Moore's "&lt;em&gt;Nemo: Heart of Ice&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/a&gt;, albeit this is a far more understated tale. The sense is of a protracted, exhausting time spent covering the distance, through punishing conditions, and it's surprisingly evocative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrative leans into the disorientation, making nothing clear. Your companion becomes increasingly cryptic. He urges you onward, never pausing more than absolutely necessary. The deer behave increasingly strangely. Your companion regales you with sickening tales of the investigative mistreatment he subjected them to on his previous visit. By the time the strange mushrooms come into play it is very obvious that you are in a place to which you should never have come, very far from anywhere or anyone, with mounting dread, alone with with a madman. What happened the last time he took this route? What did he leave behind here? What awaits at your journey's end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to know whether the difficulty of interpretation, or the non-literal aspects of your journey, are intended as the result of your character's mushroom-induced fever, or the pretensions of intrusively figurative allusions. Most likely, it seems to be both. The deliberate ambiguity runs deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn't outstay its welcome, all done in an hour. But the memories remain.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>completed</category><category>drugs</category><category>geek</category><category>media</category><category>pc</category><category>videogame</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/that-which-gave-chase/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 21:56:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Soma</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/soma/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Frictional Games, published 2015&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt="Soma - protagonist" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2022/soma-protagonist.webp"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soma is a creepy survival horror game, that leans deeply into the moral and
existential quandaries arising from the deterministic principle that it's
possible to scan one's brain and copy the structure into some other substrate,
yielding a second conscious entity, which thinks it is you. So there are deep
science-fiction issues in play here, about whether we think such a scheme could
ever possibly work, and about the practical, personal, and societal
ramifications of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major &lt;span style="background:#bb2200; color:white; border-radius: 1em; padding-left: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em; padding-top: 2px;"&gt;spoilers&lt;/span&gt; ahead. It's seven years old at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved the setup. A humdrum morning begins in your present-day Toronto
apartment. A note on the fridge reminds you that today is the day of your
medical appointment, a brain scan. Reaching the doctor's office by train, you
find the experimental new type of brain scanner, run by some PhD in a
cable-strewn side-office. Sit in the chair, don the helmet, wait for the scan
to complete and- blink! Suddenly, you are elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the game progresses, it becomes obvious that the version of you that sat
down in the seat did not experience this discontinuity. They completed the
scan, removed the helmet, and continued their normal, everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are not that copy. You open your eyes to a grim, decrepit cyberpunk future.
Exploring, your only company is a menagerie of half-functional robots and
drones, many of which are insane, and, in conversation, seem to be under the
impression that they are human beings. It gradually becomes apparent that
perceptual filters are in play, preventing them - and you - from noticing they
are no longer human. At one point the ocean crashes in on you, and you drown
for a little while, or at least think you are, but you still don't die. At that
point you have to acknowledge the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have awoken to the year 2104, and the recorded brain scans of real humans
are being used to animate drones. This is a scenario much like that told from a
different perspective in the smashing short story
&lt;a href="https://qntm.org/mmacevedo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by qntm.
Failing systems engaged fall-backs, resulting in your obsolete brain scan being
yanked from storage to inhabit an advanced humanoid robot, in a facility deep
under the ocean, some time after a comet strike has scoured all life from the
planet's surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that wasn't bad enough, one facilitating technology of this nightmarish
scenario, a black goo that mimics and improves upon electrical and biological
circuitry it comes into contact with, has run rampant, growing probing tendrils
which are wrecking the facility. Among other effects, it has reanimated the
corpses of the last few humans, who skulk around, not in a good way. As our
protagonist asks, incredulously, "You mean they've been brought back to life?".
Our reassuring AI companion replies "Yeah, let's call it that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game borrows the highly effective mechanics of Frictional's previous games,
the Amnesia and Penumbra series, where the proximity of horrific, shambling
enemies causes your character to experience debilitating symptoms, including,
in this case, static-y visual distortions as your neural hardware suffers from
some overload or interference. This applies even if you simply look at an
enemy, an act which immediately draws their attention. So your only chance to
survive encounters is to stay well out of sight, and actively avert your eyes
so you can't even watch what's going on. Not being able to see exactly what
your enemies are, or what they are up to, turns out to be fabulously scary and
atmospheric. At one point it lead directly to my wife catching me staring
intently at a blank, black screen for a prolonged period, with a peculiar
expression on my face, as I hid in a dark cupboard waiting for the slithering
sounds behind me to go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spurring us through this environment are not just threats to our immediate
survival, but also the adoption of a project, to launch into space a
solar-powered simulation, hosting all the last remaining brain scans of the
now-defunct human race, known as the 'ARK'. This will allow the on-board sims
to live a prolonged period of idyllic virtual existence, preserving at least
some echo of what humanity was. Since the conceit of the game is that our
character is a living and conscious entity that feels real emotion, the sims on
the ARK are all presumably the same, so this seems like a worthwhile endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are guided, motivated, and assisted by "Catherine", a simulated personality
running on our hand-held omni-tool, based on the brain recording of an AI
researcher, whose project during her lifetime was the ARK. Plugging her in to a
wall or console socket lets her interface with our surroundings, activating
power supplies and manipulating machinery. She leads us through a series of
undersea facilities, linked by trains, submersibles, and the occasional
disorienting trudge across the murky ocean floor, stirred up by ferocious
currents and landslides, populated by organic-mechanical hybrid horrors that
glide by in the darkness. I found these some of the absolute best, most
atmospheric "walking simulator" moments I've experienced in a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt="The ocean floor, stirred up by currents and landslides" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2022/soma-murky.webp"&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Is that another distant light up ahead? Good luck finding them while the currents pummel you,
and hideous, deadly beasts loom out of the murk.
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, we encounter a few unforgettable scenarios. We come across the
failing storage system in which the last remaining copy of our own brain scan
resides. I decide to flip some buttons which delete it, prompting my character
to respond with something like "Let this be the last time I wake up in this
godforsaken place."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At another point, we find ourselves trapped within a collapsing facility on the
bottom of the ocean, with the gibbering undead hammering on the door from the
next room. There is an airlock leading out into the ocean, but we would be
crushed at this depth. There is no way out. Luckily, Catherine is able to guide
us into assembling a more robust robot, one capable of withstanding the
pressure - all we have to do is sit in the chair and activate the transfer into
it. We already did this once, back in Toronto. Easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, after the transfer, we glance back across the lab at our original - the
pictured chap with red LED eyes - who, we notice, is still breathing. Asking
Catherine about it, she reminds us that the brain scan is not a destructive
operation. He's still in there, chemically subdued for the moment, but he'll
soon wake up again, wondering why the transfer didn't work. So we are left with
the option of stomping out of the airlock to safety, leaving him behind to his
nightmarish fate. Or flipping a switch to deactivate him before we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of these narrative beats work better as a game than they perhaps might in
a written story. They emphasize the player's complicity, your moral
culpability, which is a mode that games, for all their faults, can do better
than any other media. Plenty of the lesser moments along the way expose the
player to decisions about unplugging some human simulation or other which
declares itself to be "alive", but which is gating your progress in some way.
Some of them are yourself. Some of these acts require manhandling weighty
cables, which require large, insistent tugging with the mouse controls. It's
not just a disembodied button press. One has to provide a determined,
definitive, mechanical input to end a life. In context, the guilt feels real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the journey, we finally stumble across an honest-to-goodness real,
live human being. She describes how the rest of the humans will be gathered in
particular locations, while she stayed to protect the ARK. But, we tell her, we
just passed through those locations, and there were no humans remaining there.
We both know that the planet's surface is sterile. A beat passes before she
announces "So I'm the last human being left alive." She's deathly sick, and
without hope. By the end of your interactions she asks you to turn off her
life-support before you leave, and stay with her for her last wheezing moments.
So this is how humanity ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrying on, because what else is there to do? We finally we get the ARK loaded
into the launch system that delivers it to orbit, upload our brain scans onto
it just before it launches, and - we've done it! Success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a moment, about five minutes before the end, when I realized what was
going to happen here, even though my character had not. It was a real emotional
blow. I envied and pitied him for his naive hope. For believing there was still
a way out. For, of course, the ARK's launch changed nothing for us. Our
simulations are aboard it, but we are still sitting here, in a broken robot
corpse in a collapsing facility at the bottom of a haunted ocean on a dead
planet. The dispatched copy will enjoy life on the ARK, but we - like the copy
of ourselves we left behind earlier - are stuck here for good. Roll credits.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>completed</category><category>geek</category><category>media</category><category>pc</category><category>videogame</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/soma/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2022 18:51:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Infra</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/infra/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2024/infra.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Released in 2016, played by me on Linux in 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much to love about this game. My enjoyment was perhaps stoked by my initial
expectation that such a humdrum, non-mainstream game idea - of a civil engineer
performing building inspections, documenting elements such as cracks and exposed
rebar - must surely be a modest indie offering. But that expectation was vastly
exceeded by the overwhelming generosity of the included content, providing level
after level after level, all rich in geometry and atmosphere, navigable pathways
surrounded by loads of non-essential scene setting, from broom cupboards to
passing container ships, replete with specially coded set-pieces, and a story
that expands in scope beyond all possible initial expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is filled with puzzles that are grounded in the atmospheric setting, having
me clamber under cobweb-strewn desks with a flashlight, looking for tripped
circuit breakers. The setting itself builds beautifully, starting with my
inspection of bridges and decrepit sawmills as I wander along a small overgrown
river path, but increasing in scope and severity as we continue downstream into
town, culminating in varied and ambitious city facilities, from water treatment
plants, abandoned sprawling secret WWI facilities, and various types of railway
and power stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The puzzle difficulty is perfectly judged, demanding about the limit of effort I
could bring to bear, and only on one or two occasions did I give up and find
solutions online, leading overall to a tremendous sense of accomplishment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storyline exposes longstanding secretive corruption in the city, explaining
both the pervasive neglect and sabotage that your inspections reveal, and it
provides a variety of creative reasons why the buildings on your route are
either long-abandoned, or else hastily evacuated moments before your arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives you gloriously free reign over the facilities you pass through,
opening up possibilities to perform ad-hoc repairs as you go. In particular, I
particularly loved the way a successful navigation of levels like the water
treatment plant requires the player to cross reference wall charts showing how
the plant operates, with computer schematics showing the state of various
machinery and valves, and overlay on top of that an understanding of a few signs
and hand-written notes left behind by operators, to remind themselves about
proper operating procedures, broken equipment, workarounds, and switches that
were wired up backwards. And once you figure out this abstract understanding of
what needs to be done, you have to map it all onto the actual 3D spatial layout
of the massive hardware all around you, which often spans multiple buildings.
Just delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should probably also mention the penultimate level, which is one of the most
ambitious of many bold experiments that keep the levels diverse and surprising,
by straying away from the core conceit. In this case that means navigating the
locked-down hallways of an alternative, mushroom obsessed commune, squatting in
a depressing tower block surrounded by trash. While this level is laudable for
being the boldest of these experiments, and represents an important pillar of
the narrative, an alternate society dropping out from the dysfunction induced in
the city by the main story line. However, it didn't quite land for me, and I
soon consulted an online walkthrough, without which I think I would have been
trudging its grimy corridors for a long and dispiriting time. As it was, in
contrast to the entire rest of the game, I was pleased to get it done as quickly
as possible and move on without getting into its optional exploration and
side-quests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But other than that one level, I &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; this game, and played it with a passion
and obsession that burned fiercely for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>completed</category><category>drugs</category><category>geek</category><category>media</category><category>pc</category><category>videogame</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/infra/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Aug 2022 20:43:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Journey</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/journey/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2022/journey-screenshot.webp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Released on PlayStation 3 by thatgamecompany in 2012. Played on Windows 10 in
2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slow-paced opening scenes, alternately trudging up and then surfing down
sunbaked desert dunes, failed to sustain Zander's interest, so I ended up
playing through its short runtime by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways it's an indictment of videogame culture that ten years later it
still feels so fresh and radical to pair players up with another internet
rando, while giving them no means to communicate or interact other than helping
each other out, either leading by example, or exchanging wordless shouts. It
seems like a pretty limited repertoire at first. I'm half tempted to just wander
off ahead, alone, into the endless desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, you realize that standing close enough together recharges each other's
magical flying scarves. Suddenly, it's enough. You cling to each other for dear
life through the howling storms, double back to rescue each other from prowling
beasts, and then fly exuberantly above the sunlit clouds, forever curving back
to seek each other's life-giving sustenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know who the two internet randos were, with whom I shared the first and
second halves of my journey. But in those minutes together, we lived a
lifetime's worth.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>completed</category><category>geek</category><category>media</category><category>pc</category><category>videogame</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/journey/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 11:22:20 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Subnautica: Below Zero</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/subnautica-below-zero/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC, published 2021&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://subnautica.fandom.com/wiki/Subnautica_Wiki"&gt;Subnautica&lt;/a&gt;,
and its icy sequel,
"&lt;a href="https://subnautica.fandom.com/wiki/Subnautica:_Below_Zero"&gt;Below Zero&lt;/a&gt;",
have perhaps been my favorite
games of the last few years. The majority of their run time takes place under
the colorful waters of an alien ocean. It's been a joy to sit side-by-size
with Zander for tense scuba cave dives, or piloting vehicles through
vertiginous underwater cave systems, headlights straining through the murk to
reveal wonders. It has inspired
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_Below_Zero/comments/r82l3i/birthday_cake_no_spoilers/"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the games take place on land though. I &lt;em&gt;started&lt;/em&gt; drawing a map of Below
Zero's Glacial Basin region just to keep track of where we'd been. To make sure
we visited all the locations, found all the MacGuffins (I'm looking at &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;,
pesky antidote), and experienced all that there was to experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as those goals approached completion, I &lt;em&gt;finished&lt;/em&gt; drawing it because it
had become a therapeutic experience. Happily exploring away, mesmerised by the
scenery, avoiding hostile wildlife, uncovering the ruins of ancient alien
artifacts. Reckoning distances by eye, scribbling down what we found, updating
and correcting the map as we went. Being lost in the experience. Simply a joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_Below_Zero/comments/qutkqz/hand_drawn_map_of_southern_glacial_region_wip/"&gt;Reddit is encouraging me&lt;/a&gt;
to tackle the tricky Actic Spires area, too. &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;Rubs hands&amp;gt;...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows, 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was always going to turn my head, marrying a marvellous geometric engine
to an austere, flat-shaded renderer. Bewildering portals, seamlessly disguised
as humble doorways, are the simplest of its tricks. More pervasive, levels are
wraparound along all three spatial dimensions, as can be seen by the
disorienting arrays of geometry - the current level, infinitely repeated,
offset or re-oriented - marching to the vanishing points, dwindling to infinity
in all directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is no mere trippy backdrop. Gravity can be trivially flipped to lie along
any cardinal axis, and one will routinely step off, into a yawning, infinite
abyss, to fall through the entire level, and beyond, through and amongst the
infinite constellations of geometry, airsteering all the way, to land,
unharmed, anywhere that's exposed to the direction you're falling from. It
becomes a form of teleportation, used to get from A to B almost as frequently
as simply walking around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This non-Euclidean wrapping is baked deeply into the visuals, the engine, and
the gameplay. But for all that technical mastery, the puzzles themselves aren't
as deep and creative and varied as those in the ostensibly similar, but
less technically accomplished, &lt;em&gt;Antichamber&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, there's something entirely appropriate in this. The puzzles
end up being as much rituals as a head-scratchers, holy spatial rites one
performs to unleash the deeply evocative visuals towards the end of each level
- a faceted and angular psychedelic, coupled with unnerving reformulations of
reality straight out of Farbrausch's
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqu_IpkOYBg"&gt;Debris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. By the final level,
this crescendos in scenes reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, profound in
both the intimacy of my commune with godhood, and in my continued inability to
understand what I had achieved. Created a universe, probably? Yeah, probably.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>completed</category><category>geek</category><category>media</category><category>pc</category><category>videogame</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/manifold-garden/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 03:16:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Thief Level : Week 2</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/thief-level-week-2/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;This week I spent a little while considering the backstory of the level,
and now have at least a rudimentary scenario: Garrett the thief is
taking an opportunistic foray into the local Shope of Curiosities,
having heard that their prize exhibit, the McGuffin of Antioc, has been
removed from its high-security public display, in order to be cleaned or
maintained somewhere on-site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of this, I've been refining the layout of the museum building,
starting with the two-storey entrance hall, complete with a balcony
running round it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="sketch of museum's two-storey main entrance hall" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2010/02/w02-sketch-entrance.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, I've been planning the possible routes a thief might take to get
from one room to another. Generally, the conventional paths - in through
the main entrance and up the stairs and down the corridor - will be
blocked by guards. So the player has to clamber up the outside of the
building, explore the roof, dangle from a rope, pick a lock, find a key
in the janitor's quarters, which opens all the windows, and ledges
outside a couple of windows lead somewhere interesting, etc. I don't
want it to turn into a key fetch quest, but at the same time, I don't
want the player to be able to simply waltz all through the whole
building. I've tried to engineer a single interesting primary route
through the building, with the possibility of a few minor variations so
players feel like they can exercise some freedom and decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="sketch of ground floor" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2010/02/w02-sketch-ground-floor.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having done all that, I'm now quite happy that my plans are sufficient
to produce a small but adequate level. I'll aim to get that complete,
and any fancy window dressing I can layer on top will be a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I completed the modelling of all the rooms in the building, and
doorframes inbetween them. I applied some quick floorboard textures to
differentiate the floors and ceilings from the walls. Here you can see
the view from the main entrance, looking into the two-storey entrance
hall, with the balcony around it visible up on the next level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="main entraince with floorboards" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2010/02/w02-main-entrance.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the view while approaching the top of the stairs, looking down over
the balcony. There will be a railing when it's done:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Approaching the top of the stairs" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2010/02/w02-top-of-stairs-balcony.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks heaps to Qolelis for a comment with a tip about textures on
stairways, to rotate the texture 90 degrees on each stair's vertical
rise. I only just saw that, but will definitely apply it this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: I feel a bit self-concious that I'm creating the bare
minimum that could qualify to be a Thief level. There is not yet a
lively, engaging backstory to the level, complete with colorful
characters, cleverly intertwined with the canon of the original game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the mechanical contents of my level are as simple as
possible. I haven't stretched myself, thinking of imaginative locations
or motives for Garrett to explore. I do not plan to have any clever
special objects or custom scripting in my level, defining dramatic
changing mission objectives as the player reveals new information. It's
a very straightforward 'get into a building, steal the loot, and get
out'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partly this is very deliberate - I want the level to be as minimal as it
can possibly be, so as keep it achievable. But also, this is partly in
response to my feeling that being creative is hard, especially when
under pressure. Right now I feel as though I have enough to worry about
just getting to grips with the minutia of the level editor. I almost
feel as if I need to become comfortable with that before I can relax
enough to get creative with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't entirely unexpected. Clearly one cannot do great work on
one's first attempt. But at the same time, I don't want to just 'give
up' on the creative aspects. I want to do as good a job as I can do,
under the constraints of a small, straightforward 'first time' level
done in a reasonable timeframe. So maybe I just need to keep iterating.
Embelish the dramatic backstory little by little, see what occurs to me
as I go on. Look for some flash of inspiration as I bury myself in the
process. Fair enough. Baby steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2:&lt;/strong&gt; I created a quick TODO list, as a first approximation of
how much work there is to be done. I ended up with a list of 67
mandatory items (eg. Add doors inside each door frame; First pass at
lighting; Add balcony railing.) In addition I have 18 optional items
(eg. Add carpets and rugs; Hide moss arrows in the garden; Entrance hall
main exhibit.) The screenshots above represent about six completed items
(eg. Dromed tutorials; first floor rooms; doorways and arches between
rooms; staircase.) So at the current rate, it's roughly 28 weeks of
work, which is double or triple what I'd planned on. Hopefully my rate
of completing items will increase substantially as I get into the
groove. I'll have to monitor this going forward, and slash scope if I
can't drastically accelerate.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>gamedev</category><category>geek</category><category>pc</category><category>thief</category><category>videogame</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/thief-level-week-2/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2010 19:20:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Creating a Level for Thief 2</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/creating-a-level-for-thief-2/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.tartley.com/posts/sinister-redux"&gt;Sinister Ducks&lt;/a&gt;, my &lt;a href="http://www.gamedevlessons.com/"&gt;videogame
creation mentor&lt;/a&gt; suggested that I create
a mod for an existing game, in order to distance myself a little from
the programming aspects of creating a game, and instead spend a little
time considering the gameplay and the art and the music from the
perspective of the user. Sounds like useful advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the last couple of weeks I've been working through the
&lt;a href="http://www.jasonotto.net/tutorials/CompleteTut.htm"&gt;tutorials&lt;/a&gt; for
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DromEd"&gt;DromEd&lt;/a&gt;, the notoriously cranky
level editor for vintage sneak-em-up &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thief:_The_Dark_Project"&gt;Thief: The Dark
Project&lt;/a&gt;.
(Specifically for the sequel, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thief_II:_The_Metal_Age"&gt;Thief 2: The Metal
Age&lt;/a&gt;, which has a
slightly improved engine and editor.) I chose this for three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Released in 1998, &lt;em&gt;Thief&lt;/em&gt; is old enough that the assets are simple
    &lt;a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/thief-ii-the-metal-age/screenshots/gameShotId,7666/"&gt;low-fidelity geometry and
    bitmaps&lt;/a&gt;.
    These are easy enough for me to create and edit, plus if I
    intersperse existing game assets with my own shoddy creations, there
    won't be a tremendously jarring disparity in apparent quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even though &lt;em&gt;Thief&lt;/em&gt; is ten years old and the company that created it
    long gone, there's still &lt;a href="http://www.ttlg.com/"&gt;a thriving
    community&lt;/a&gt; of amateur afficionados, churning
    out &lt;a href="http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?p=1508201"&gt;new
    missions&lt;/a&gt; at
    the rate of several per month, many of which are of exceedingly high
    quality - in some cases exceeding that of the original game. I'll be
    in good company, will have some meaningful feedback, and will have
    forums to turn to when I get into difficulties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last but not least, &lt;em&gt;Thief&lt;/em&gt; is one of my favourite games of all
    time. The emphasis on sneaking around and avoiding confrontation
    suits my sensibilities. Your protagonist, Garrett, is a marvellous,
    mercenary character. Best of all, in &lt;em&gt;Thief 1&lt;/em&gt;, it reveals
    unexpected depth halfway through - the player's expectations of a
    succession of simple heists takes a strange twist when the powerful
    storyline reveals itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having finished the tutorials, this weekend I broke ground on creating
my own level, or 'fan-mission' (FM), in the parlance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Designing a Thief2 Level in DromEd" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2010/01/dromed-sm.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm using the DromEd Toolkit, which is DromEd with some third-party
patches and bugfixes applied to it. My first impressions with DromEd are
that it's very clunky and ugly, and startlingly lacking in
documentation. I've taken to dipping into the configuration files to see
what keyboard commands exist to experiment with. There are a bewildering
variety of binary patches to modify the executable in various exciting
ways, and forum posts about it, although helpful and prolific, seem
fragmentary and rife with broken links. I've still no idea whether I
ought to be using &lt;em&gt;Dromed Delux&lt;/em&gt; instead, nor where I should get that
from. It's a glorious chaotic riot, and it's a little intimidating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, having said that, the binary patches have all worked fine for me,
and the more I use the editor, the more it's starting to grow on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm setting my FM in a museum. There's already an existing museum
mission out there, but as opposed to its marble-halled austerity, I'm
imagining this will be more like the cramped, cosy, wood-panneled
chaotic collection of something like the wonderful &lt;a href="http://www.britishtours.com/360/soane-museum.html"&gt;Sir John Soane's
Museum&lt;/a&gt; in London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So progress as of week 1 looks like this: I've carved out some very
basic geometry to form a stocky museum building. Here you can just about
make out a hole in the brick facade that will form the front entrance.
This is not the entrance that the player will likely be using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2010/01/front-entrance.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all very crude thus far - with repeating textures on large
surfaces, and plain uniform lighting. There are a complete set of mostly
rectangular ground-floor rooms, with interconnecting doorways. The
highlight of my modelling to date is this stairway leading up to the
(otherwise nonexistant) next floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2010/01/stairway.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not so happy with the wood texture I chose - I'll go back and look
for something more uniform. But I am happy with the way the stairs flair
out at the bottom. I realised in the process of creating this that this
makes it possible to fit a flight of stairs into a smaller space than
would otherwise be possible, by allowing the bottom few steps to
gracefully project out into the corridor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having finished this last night, I then dreamed about geometric
operations on three dimensional spaces, which I think is a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>creative</category><category>gamedev</category><category>geek</category><category>pc</category><category>thief</category><category>videogame</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/creating-a-level-for-thief-2/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jan 2010 19:50:26 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
