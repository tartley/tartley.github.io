&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Amal El-Mohtar &amp;amp; Max Gladstone, 2019&lt;/em&gt; &lt;img alt="spoilers" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/spoilers.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a marvellous literary romp, deploying the tropes and language of science
fiction to deliver a scintillatingly poetic payload of — dare I say it —
credible romance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combatants in the Time War seek to bring about historical outcomes which
predispose those futures which will result in the generation of their own
particular civilisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one future, humans have embraced machine-oriented augmentation, uploads,
and all that that implies. In the other, transformation is wrought by
biological means, accepting humankind's role as a part of a natural ecosystem,
boostrapping the whole to greatness by a ruthless application of evolutionary
principles. Each finds the other repulsive. From our perspective, they appear
equally awe-inspiring and terrible to behold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as intriguing as all that is, it's not why we're here. Instead we get
the much more personal accounts of two omni-capable antagonists on the front
lines. Theirs is a subtle art, weaving probabilities of lasting change through
very human interventions - as well as wading knee deep in the dead when
occasion demands it, to tip the scales of pivotal battles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding each other with wariness and respect, from across the gulf of
realities, they battle up the threads and down the braids of innumerable
possible pasts and futures. Until they begin sending what can only be
characterized as &lt;em&gt;letters&lt;/em&gt; to each other, albeit often encoded in startlingly
— poetically — obscure ways, so as to remain secret from their enemies and
their masters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around these letters are formed the novel's tight, alternating structure,
reminding me of Bank's &lt;em&gt;Use of Weapons&lt;/em&gt;. Before you know it, their respect for
each other's skills has grown to full-blown giddy all-out love. But where to
from there? Their communications to date are already grounds for terminal
repercussions. Nowhen in the multiverse are they safe from their respective
commanders. Losing the time war would mean they no longer — had never —
existed. Winning the time war would mean the same for their opposite number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At which point, the novel cleverly folds back on itself - these are consummate
masters of time and subtle but decisive influence, after all - to perform an
act of escapology, hinting to us that all their previous acts and letters could
be re-construed as having left a trail, ready to be exploited once the moment
was right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="The Buried Giant cover" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2021/the-buried-giant-cover.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Kazuo Ishiguro, 2015&lt;/em&gt; &lt;img alt="spoilers" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/spoilers.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A haunting and melancholic tale set in a mythical post-Arthurian England,
populated by ragged peoples, affected by a pervasive amnesia. Elderly couple
Axl and Beatrice abruptly decide to leave their village of damp, hobbit-like
underground burrows to visit a son they'd forgotten they had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other characters are inspired by a variety of sources, from Beowulf to Arthur's
knight and nephew Sir Gawain, now old and prone to quixotic rants - hinting at
the subconscious conflict his code of honor has with the dark means by which he
and other knights helped Arthur achieve the current uneasy peace between native
Britons and invading Saxons, now occupying villages across the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey is perilous, encountering roaming ogres and deadly pixies, not
to mention soldiers of the local lords, and deadly conflicts within the party
itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But any action is relayed with cool distance. Either through the pervasive
mental fog, or using expert fighters' clinical analysis of the minutia of
stance or grip, or by foretelling the ebb and flow of a battle by analysing the
terrain, then allowing the battle itself to take place off stage, only assumed
to have happened, by characters who weren't there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This muted indirectness is entirely in keeping with the ambiguous, dreamlike
style of the book, which is heightened by the sing-song formalism of the
characters' speech, and the narrator's occasional surreal hint of relating this
tale to contemporaries who live in some other, unidentifiable, historic time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey eventually comes to revolve around the dispatch - or defence - of a
dragon that is said to be the source of everyone's forgetfulness, and as this
goal approaches, vague fears surface of what might be remembered when the
mist lifts. Will Axl and Beatrice's treasured relationship survive the
revelations of their pasts? Will the longstanding truce in the land survive
the remembering of wartime battles and atrocities? Will Saxon resentment at
Arthur's desperate misdeeds be stoked into resumption of the violent war of
invasion? This is left unresolved by the novel's end, but as reader, we know
that the Saxons did ultimately conquer all of England, displacing the Britons
culturally and politically, and possibly murdering a good number of them along
the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I'm minded to think of ancient England here as being the root of
modern Western culture, and the mist as an allegory for the bland ignorance of
our own culture's atrocities. The deliberate forgetting, like the mist, clouds
all our conciousnesses, making it hard for us to remember who we are. Why we're
here. The silent resentment of crushed minorities and genocide survivors forms
a pressure, struggling against the placating narrative that everything's OK
now. But, contained, the pressure builds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly a buried giant, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Edward Snowden, 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed this memoir. The story is familiar, but intriguing to hear
in the characteristically articulate words of Snowden himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He recounts growing up as a computer nerd in a family dedicated to military
service, punctuated by startling scenes such as being caught in the pandemonium
outside NSA headquarters as it was evacuated during 9/11, and the subsequent
overreach of surveillance capability that triggered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He describes the interesting parts of his ascent through jobs, and clearance
levels, within the intelligence community, and how he came to slowly suspect —
and later confirm — that the government was collecting all the communications
and transactions, from everyone who touched a phone or computer, in America and
across the world. A vast spying mechanism turned upon the populace, beyond the
wildest dreams of the Stasi, who only surveilled one third of their population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At "Constitution Day" in the office, a forlorn desk in the cafeteria hands
out copies of the constitution, which his clearance had required that he, and
his colleagues, swear an oath to uphold. He quoted the 4th amendment to
colleagues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and
effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The responses were dead-eyed shrugs - yeah, sure, but what can you do? What
indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He describes the dangers of a government given too much power to spy on
the everyday lives of its citizens, and the crisis of conscience that slowly
lead to his decision to let the American people know that they were being spied
upon, and his planning of how to go about it. How he slowly accumulated the
hundreds of documents needed to reveal the full extent and capabilities of the
spying apparatus. The extraction of those documents, hidden on his person on
micro SD cards, concealed in places such as in a Rubik's cube he routinely
carried through security. The months long process of selecting journalists who
could both communicate the material coherently to the public, and vet the
public releases to eliminate the risk to our undercover personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His recounts the preparations for flight, tying up his affairs like a man about
to die. Emptying bank accounts, leaving cash for his girlfriend to find.
Leaving the house tidy and repaired. The necessity of flight, to avoid a show
trial, devoid of any meaningful defense. A whistle-blower is not allowed to
argue that their disclosures were civilly beneficial. Even now, when Snowden's
leaks have caused Congress to change laws regarding surveillance, or caused the
courts to strike down types of mass surveillance programs as illegal, or caused
both the Attorney General and the President of the United States to admit that
the resulting debase over mass surveillance was a crucial one for the public to
have. All these claims would be dismissed by the court as not just irrelevant,
but inadmissible, leading to a sentence of up to ten years per leaked document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, flight itself. A tense series of airplanes and delays, meeting the
selected journalists in Hong Kong, selected for being sufficiently disjoint
from Chinese rule so as not to taint his revelations with the suspicion of
having sold out to China, but still sufficiently lawful, and under the auspices
of the distant Chinese rule, that that the American government would not snatch
him off the street with impunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indulgence of the Hong Kong government fell apart, as the US filed for
extradition. He fled bound for Equador, but was pulled aside during a 20-hour
layover in a Moscow airport, for a conversation with Russian intelligence,
during which Snowden insists he will not work with them, he only wants to catch
his flight out. They reveal to him that he cannot leave, since the US State
department has cancelled his passport. He is stranded in Moscow airport for 40
days, and eventually granted temporary asylum in Russia. Eventually, his
girlfriend — who knew nothing about his plans — recovered from the shock of his
unannounced departure, moved out to Moscow to be with him, and then a year
later, they were married.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Manifold Garden screenshot" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2021/manifold-garden.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows, 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was always going to turn my head, marrying a marvellous geometric engine
to an austere, flat-shaded renderer. Bewildering portals, seamlessly disguised
as humble doorways, are the simplest of its tricks. More pervasive, levels are
wraparound along all three spatial dimensions, as can be seen by the
disorienting arrays of geometry - the current level, infinitely repeated,
offset or re-oriented - marching to the vanishing points, dwindling to infinity
in all directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is no mere trippy backdrop. Gravity can be trivially flipped to lie along
any cardinal axis, and one will routinely step off, into a yawning, infinite
abyss, to fall through the entire level, and beyond, through and amongst the
infinite constellations of geometry, airsteering all the way, to land,
unharmed, anywhere that's exposed to the direction you're falling from. It
becomes a form of teleportation, used to get from A to B almost as frequently
as simply walking around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This non-Euclidian wrapping is baked deeply into the visuals, the engine, and
the gameplay. But for all that technical mastery, the puzzles themselves aren't
as deep and creative and varied as those in the ostensibly similar, but
less technically accomplished, &lt;em&gt;Antichamber&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, there's something entirely appropriate in this. The puzzles
end up being as much rituals as a headscratchers, holy spatial rites one
performs to unleash the deeply evocative visuals towards the end of each level
- a faceted and angular psychadelic, coupled with unnerving reformulations of
reality straight out of Farbrausch's
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqu_IpkOYBg"&gt;Debris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. By the final level,
this crescendos in scenes reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, profound in
both the intimacy of my commune with godhood, and in my continued inability to
understand what I had achieved. Created a universe, probably? Yeah, probably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>completed</category><category>game</category><category>media</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/manifold-garden/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 03:16:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Glass Bead Game</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/the-glass-bead-game-by-hermann-hesse-1943/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float: left"&gt;
&lt;img alt="The Glass Bead Game cover" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2021/glass-bead-game-cover.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Hermann Hesse (1943). Translated from German to English with evident
devotion and expertise by Clara Winston &amp;amp; Richard Winston.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;img alt="spoilers" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/spoilers.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This novel is described by some as the culmination of Hesse's career, for
which he received a Nobel Prize for Literature. Many reviews on Goodreads
cite it as a life-changing novel, or as a singular all-time favorite book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must confess with some sadness that I must have entirely missed the point. I
have not enjoyed it &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;. The number of books I failed to finish in my
life is surely less than five, and this very nearly became one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first half describes Knecht's education and career within the rarefied
academic atmosphere of some distant future European state's "pedagogical
province", wherein (exclusively male) scholars devote their time to
mastery of the titular game. This relies upon drawing deep relationships
between all fields of human study, such as music and biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knecht is talented and likeable, and rises effortlessly through the ranks,
without exhibiting any real volition of his own, other than being naturally
predisposed to study, and having an instinct for drawing out the best in
people. He is ultimately assigned to the highest office in the land, without
encountering any substantive antagonist or difficulty along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanics of the game itself, about which all this ostensibly revolves, is
deliberately never explained, other than poetic references to glass beads
being used to exquisitely interrelate insights or concepts from multiple fields
of study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first half of the book bored me to absolute tears. If I had to find a
single word to describe Knecht, despite his diligence, it would be "inactive".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the halfway point through the book, this serenity is interrupted by
Knecht making the controversial decision to quit, not just from his exalted
post, but from the whole system over which it rules. He leaves the insular
academic province entirely, to begin a new life, subject to more real-world
constraints. Just at this very moment, as the narrative becomes interesting,
this section abruptly ends in a very unexpected manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the whole book, this moment resonates with me. Knecht has spent a life
devoted to scholarly thought, but after many decades he throws off the
expectations of that life to forge his own path. Mere days after that decision,
a moment of physical exertion proves to be his sudden undoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this show that Knecht should have more highly valued the protections from
the physical world that his intellectual castle provided? That someone raised
in such a cosseted environment was unsuitable to face the rigors of the real
world? Or should I instead observe that, despite his ostensible success and
satisfaction with life, in waiting so long before daring to strike out on his
own, and then find days later that his time was up, Knecht has in some ways
wasted his life doing something other than what he really wanted to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither of these seem particularly compelling to me, nor sufficient for
the larger themes that I suspect the book might actually be grappling with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second half of the book contains various poems, written by Knecht when he
was younger, containing premonitions of his aspirations and his doubts. It ends
with three short tales, each describing an alternate life that Knecht might
have lived in other times. Apparently early drafts had these tales being
literal other lives Knecht was reincarnated into. But in the published book,
they are presented without context, and I think it is only by consensus
that they are commonly understood to be grouped with the earlier poems as
examples of Knecht's writing - his imagination of other lives he might have
lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not understand the relevance of these tales to the larger portion of
the book, other than the way they forcefully contrast with it, by immersing
Knecht in emotional and painful tales of life embedded within a wider society,
rather than abstractly observing its achievements from without. As such,
they force him into action, and to me they are more engaging for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia informs me that each of the four tales of Knecht's life focuses on a
different basic aspect of analytical psychology: thinking (Magister Ludi),
sensation (The Rainmaker), intuition (Indian life) and feeling (The Father
Confessor). Similarly, several of the book's characters who had influence on
Knecht are thinly-veiled references to real world people, some famous such
as Friedrich Nietzsche, others being acquaintances of the author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of which seems reasonable, but doesn't really help me understand what I
just read. Perhaps each tale of Knecht, in focussing on one human trait,
is lacking because it undervalues the other three. Perhaps. ¯\&lt;em&gt;(ツ)&lt;/em&gt;/¯&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>book</category><category>media</category><category>novel</category><category>science-fiction</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/the-glass-bead-game-by-hermann-hesse-1943/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 18:37:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Keyboard CoolerMaster CK530's Missing Manual</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/keyboard-coolermaster-ck530s-missing-manual/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these are self-explanatory. For the rest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Using modes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt; is the "coolermaster" key, on the bottom row key between right Windows and
right Ctrl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When holding &lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt;, several keys might light up, depending on the current
mode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ESC/1/2/3/4&lt;/code&gt; - one of these keys flashes white to show which profile
  (see &lt;a href="https://www.tartley.com/posts/keyboard-coolermaster-ck530s-missing-manual/#profiles"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;) is currently in use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the current mode allows you to select a color to use, then &lt;code&gt;F2/F3/F4&lt;/code&gt;
  will light up to show the currently selected color's levels of
  red/green/blue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the current mode allows &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; colors to be set (foreground &amp;amp; background),
  then one of &lt;code&gt;F6/F7&lt;/code&gt; will flash white, to show which is currently affected. (See &lt;a href="https://www.tartley.com/posts/keyboard-coolermaster-ck530s-missing-manual/#foreground-and-background-colors"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressing &lt;code&gt;fn + F5&lt;/code&gt; cycles through:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5. Reactive fade&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15. Fireball&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;16. Tornado (color spin)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17. Reactive tornado&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;18. Water ripple&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;19. Snake&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modes marked "reactive" react to keypresses. Mostly this lights up a pattern
around the pressed key. In the case of "snake", you can play using the arrow
keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="foreground-and-background-colors"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Foreground &amp;amp; background colors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the modes have a foreground effect that you can change the color of.
For example, in the &lt;em&gt;all-one-color&lt;/em&gt; mode (officially called "static")
you can select the color with which all keys are lit, using &lt;code&gt;fn + F2/F3/F4&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the modes also have a second color, the background, that you can set
separately. You can see if a mode offers this by selecting the mode and holding
&lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt;. If this mode offers two settable colors, then either &lt;code&gt;F6&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;F7&lt;/code&gt; will
flash white, to show you which one you are currently setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press &lt;code&gt;fn + F6/F7&lt;/code&gt; to choose foreground or background,
then use &lt;code&gt;fn + F2/F3/F4&lt;/code&gt; to set it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="custom-mode"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Custom mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Custom (mode #6 above) lets the user assign a different color to each key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, cycle through modes using &lt;code&gt;fn + F5&lt;/code&gt; until you reach custom mode.
   It can be tricky to identify when you've reached it. Use the list of modes
   above to help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While in custom mode, press &lt;code&gt;fn + F10&lt;/code&gt; to edit key colors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select a color using &lt;code&gt;fn + F2/F3/F4&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press all the keys you want lit in the selected color. Pressing the same key
   again turns it unlit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat steps 3 &amp;amp; 4 for other color/key combinations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, save to your current profile (see &lt;a href="https://www.tartley.com/posts/keyboard-coolermaster-ck530s-missing-manual/#profiles"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;) by holding
   &lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt; and pressing your current profile key (whichever of &lt;code&gt;Esc/1/2/3/4&lt;/code&gt; is
   flashing white.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some wrinkles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't manage to set a color for the FN key itself, which always appears unlit
in this mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The caps lock key is unlit in this mode, unless caps lock is on.
Similarly, scroll lock seems to always be unlit for me in this mode,
although it is lit in other modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you try to assign a color to whichever one of &lt;code&gt;Esc/1/2/3/4&lt;/code&gt; is lit white,
to indicate the active profile, then nothing visible happens, but it is
working. You have to save (step 6 above).
Then you can see whether you successfully assigned the color,
or pressed the key one too many times and left it unlit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While editing key colors, if you wait, without exit/saving, pressing nothing
for a minute or so, then key color editing times out, cancelling all your
changes since step 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="profiles"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Profiles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are five "profiles", each of which can be used to save the current
state of the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The profiles are accessed using &lt;code&gt;fn + 1/2/3/4/Esc&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Esc&lt;/code&gt; is the "default"
profile. Current keyboard settings (e.g. illumination mode and customized
colors) can be saved to one of the five profiles, and then loaded back later.
Are macros stored in a profile? Don't know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current profile is shown when you hold &lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt;, by one of &lt;code&gt;1/2/3/4/Esc&lt;/code&gt;
flashing white. While keeping FN pressed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressing the flashing profile key will save the keyboard state to your
  current profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressing any of the other profile keys will LOAD that profile,
  losing the current keyboard state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, to save changes to an arbitrary profile, you need to select that
profile &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; making the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When turning the keyboard on (ie. plugging the USB cable into a computer),
the active profile will be whichever one was last active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>hardware</category><category>keyboard</category><category>manual</category><guid>https://www.tartley.com/posts/keyboard-coolermaster-ck530s-missing-manual/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 18:41:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Self-Calm</title><link>https://www.tartley.com/posts/self-calm/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float: left"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Self Calm cover" src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2021/self-calm-cover.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Chris DeLeon (2018)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roman Emperor Marcus Auralias' notes, traditionally titled &lt;em&gt;Meditations&lt;/em&gt;,
are a foundational text for practical Stoicism. They comprise a multitude of
observations and recommendations, grouped into sections such as "Keeping
thoughts tranquil", and "Cooperation, collaberation and contribution". They
offer advice for living a contented life, with less regret, sorrow, anger and
fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several translations exist, themselves dated from through the ages. This book
combines them, to synthesize a text which doesn't hew as precisely to the
original as a straight translation might, but is instead intended to have the
most relevance to modern ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confession: It's taken me &lt;em&gt;months&lt;/em&gt; to get through it. Partly this is because
I've allowed myself to be distracted by more gaudy and immediate books along
the way. Partly it's because I found the best way to read this was &lt;em&gt;slowly&lt;/em&gt;.
Practically every paragraph is worth reflecting upon, to consider how it
applies to my own life, and ponder what practical, specific next steps are
implied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to criticize, it would only be the superficial wrinkle that there's
a lot of repetition, such as hundreds of suggestions to not fear death.
Apparently the original documents were accumulated over decades of Auralias'
life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genuinely life changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="P.O.E.M." src="https://www.tartley.com/files/2021/poem.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The problem&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I was diagnosed with achalasia. It's a rare condition in which nerve
damage causes weak and poorly coordinated swallowing in the esophagus,
including a reluctance of the lower esophageal sphincter, leading to the
stomach, to properly relax at the appropriate moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to difficulty swallowing, regurgitation, and a column of liquid
sitting in the esophagus, which becomes distended, losing elasticity and tone.
The cause of the nerve damage is unknown, and has probably been accumulating
for decades. It's reasonable to assume this is mixed up in some way with
various ailments of my guts over the years (celiac, eosinophilic esophagitis,
chronic hiccups), but causal relationships are unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A solution, of sorts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a surgical procedure intended to allow the
esophagus to drain properly, avoiding further distension. Surgery happens
through a tube down the throat, from where they cut into the muscle wall of the
oesophagus, then tunnel down to the outside of the lower esophageal sphincter.
There, they cut some of the muscle, making the sphincter less tightly clenched,
so that food can pass more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, my symptoms were a nuisance, but perfectly endurable. The main goal
of the procedure was preventative - reduction in future damage to my esophagus.
Plus, there's an outside chance that maybe eliminating that standing fluid
might improve other matters, such as reducing irritation which maybe causes my
hiccups? Long shot, but worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of information given to the patient through the process, but
these are the things that were still surprises to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Day 0. The procedure.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've undergone a lot of regular endoscopic inspections or biopsies. At some
point, in London's splendid Imperial College Hospital, I discovered the cheat
code is to ask to do these unsedated. It's a few minutes of slightly
nightmarish discomfort, to watch a burly gentleman hand-over-hand several feet
of black rubber garden hose directly into your mouth. But the payoffs are that
without any anesthetic, there's no need to fast, the procedure itself is
simpler and safer, and best of all, recovery time is much reduced. Given a
few minutes to compose yourself, you can cycle or drive yourself home right
afterwards, making it a 45 minute appointment, instead of writing off most of
the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, going unsedated for the more substantial POEM obviously isn't an
option. It requires more than the simple sedation I've experienced before,
since apparently there's a phase at the end where they check you're regaining
consciousness and are able to breathe for yourself before they remove the
apparatus that's been breathing for you while you are paralyzed for the
procedure. This is the sort of detail that is kindly elided from the regular
patient briefing, which only came up because we were asking questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only remember coming around sometime after that point, and my first thought,
unplanned, was to test whether I could perform square and cube roots in my
head. Apparently that's my brain's idea of a power-on self test. I could do
small integers, like 27 -&amp;gt; 3, but had the presence of mind enough to see that's
just relying on remembered sequences. I was able to envision the process to do
the calculation for something which isn't a cube, like 28, but I failed to
actually execute any iterations of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said hello to a nurse sat beside me, but resisted the urge to chatter at her
about my mental state. Somehow, even I could see that from her perspective,
that would be like talking to drunk people. So now I'm doing it at you instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while they rolled me into my own room, and stuck a big pad over my
butt. &lt;em&gt;Foreshadowing!&lt;/em&gt; I fuzzily thought. I stayed in hospital overnight, for
tests the next day. Forever grateful for Suze's visits even though I wasn't
the best of company. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hiccups didn't reappear through the first few hours of my recovery, even
though I spent the time propped upright in bed. This is pretty unusual - they
usually return within seconds of me sitting up. But when they did return, they
were pretty painful. What I call "hiccups" is partly a spasm of the esophagus
itself - precisely where I'd just been cut and then clamped and sutered back
together. So I asked the nurse to dial up the pain meds, at first with breezy
British grit, and then with increasingly wild eyes and white knuckles
as they took a while to figure out a few local administrative issues, like
where the person with the keys to the drugs locker had gone. Rode out the rest
of the day in style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Day 1. Restart the line&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd brought a bunch of things for my two day hospital stay, books and media and
headphones and my own cozy pajamas to wear while garrulously socializing with
staff and adjacent patients. That was all a total waste of time. I was a write
off the entire time I was there, not able to muster the bandwidth even to watch
t.v. I saw a single episode of Schitt's Creek at one point because Suze kindly
propped it up in front of me, but I couldn't manage a 2nd. I just dozed, and
was wheeled to a barium x-ray, to check I wasn't leaking anywhere untoward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point during this day, my digestive tract started up again. It became
apparent that it had just been on strike, inactive, since the surgery. I felt
it ripple distressingly back into action, along with some impressive gurgles.
The big pad they'd stuck on me the day before turned out not to be vital in
this instance, but I can very much understand how it often might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nurse introduced me to a plastic device for measuring and exercising my
ability to inhale deeply, on which I could occasionally surpass the initial
expectation of 1,000 points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ambitions for the day were to get out of bed and take a 2 minute walk, and
later in the day to tolerate my first drinks, some water and fruit juices,
sufficiently to get approved to go home. Leaving hospital with some
prescription, gluten free, clear liquid pain killers proved to be an impossible
administrative nightmare. Nobody's fault, the system is broken. The concept of
"insurance" for healthcare is inherently dysfunctional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Day 2. Home again&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At home for five days of a clear liquid diet. This means water, strained fruit
juices &amp;amp; drinks without suspensions (i.e. no particles floating in it to make
it opaque), tea or coffee without milk, clear broths. Also, slightly bizarrely,
jell-o, since it may be eaten while solid, but at room (or body) temperature,
it's a liquid. I demurred on Suze's threat to make jello shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambitions for today were to rise from the sofa for a shower, and a walk or two
around the inside of the house. Scoring 1,500 points on the breathe-o-meter.
Importantly, I now have it together enough to be able to watch some dumb t.v.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Day 3. Outdoors.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambitions today were to take a walk or two around our yard. Scoring 2,000
points on the breathe-o-meter! Yay, progress. Able to concentrate enough to
read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Day 4.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambitions today were to take a couple of walks around the block. Scoring 3,500
points on the breathe-o-meter. I have no idea what my baseline was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Day 5.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First full day and night without any pain killers. Ambitions for today were to
take it easy and not mow the lawn (check!). Might have to get someone in to do
it for us. I'd be writhing in guilt if Suze had to go out and manhandle our
temperamental mower around. 4,500 on the breathe-o-meter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Day 6.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to work - from home, at a desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over lunch I visit the hospital for an x-ray and more tests. I was hoping to
graduate to a soft food diet today, but surgeon says that, although he's happy
with my progress, out of an abundance of caution he's going to keep me on clear
liquids until day 9. Then a soft food diet for six weeks. C'est la vie. Back
home to more apple juice. At least I'm still under instructions to take it
easy, so retain my excuse for not mowing the lawn...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Jason Shiga (2016)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm just discovering the works of &lt;a href="http://www.shigabooks.com"&gt;Jason Shiga&lt;/a&gt;,
creator of mathematically-inspired nonlinear comic-books, e.g. stories drawn
on complex origami structures, that can be folded in various ways to represent
either branching storylines, or else to manage state such as 'inventory'.
Construction of these more elaborate paper constructions doesn't scale,
(ie. I'm not likely to ever own one) but you can try some of his other
creations on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href="http://www.shigabooks.com/index.php?page=001"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt;,
a regular linear webcomic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storyline is 'math-inspired' too, in the same way that the movie &lt;em&gt;Primer&lt;/em&gt;
is - intense, absolute, ruthless, narrative exploration of logical
implications, while continually, dizzyingly, escalating to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another fabulously enjoyable science fiction adventure from qntm. Like their
other novels, it does a tremendous job of exploring the implications and
consequences of big science fiction concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, it's a story of human superheroes, whose powers derive from
beings-beyond-comprehension, from the high-dimensional multiverse, the
Structure, within which our paltry three-plus-one spacetime is naught but an
embedded decal. Their struggles rewrite the fundamental physics of our
universe, to fashion it into an inescapable trap, denying humanity access to
advanced sciences, and to communion with the higher levels of the Structure.
Loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those like me with an epub fetish, you can buy &lt;em&gt;Fine Structure&lt;/em&gt; in many
formats, including Amazon links, EPUBs, or free-to-read online, &lt;a href="https://qntm.org/structure"&gt;at the
author's site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
