&lt;img alt="Spoilers" src="https://tartley.com/files/spoilers.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major spoilers ahead. It's seven years old at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt="Soma - protagonist" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/soma-protagonist.webp"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soma is a creepy survival horror game, that leans deeply into the moral and
existential quandaries arising from the deterministic principle that it's
possible to scan one's brain and copy the structure into some other substrate,
yielding a second conscious entity, which thinks it is you. So there are deep
science-fiction issues in play here, about whether we think such a scheme could
ever possibly work, and about the practical, personal, and societal
ramifications of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved the setup. A humdrum morning begins in your present-day Toronto
apartment. A note on the fridge reminds you that today is the day of your
medical appointment, a brain scan. Reaching the doctor's office by train, you
find the experimental new type of brain scanner, run by some PhD in a
cable-strewn side-office. Sit in the chair, don the helmet, wait for the scan
to complete and- blink! Suddenly, you are elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the game progresses, it becomes obvious that the version of you that sat
down in the seat did not experience this discontinuity. They completed the
scan, removed the helmet, and continued their normal, everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are not that copy. You open your eyes to a grim, decrepit cyberpunk future.
Exploring, your only company is a menagerie of half-functional robots and
drones, many of which are insane, and, in conversation, seem to be under the
impression that they are human beings. It gradually becomes apparent that
perceptual filters are in play, preventing them - and you - from noticing they
are no longer human. At one point the ocean crashes in on you, and you drown
for a little while, or at least think you are, but you still don't die. At that
point you have to acknowledge the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have awoken to the year 2104, and the recorded brain scans of real humans
are being used to animate drones. This is a scenario much like that told from a
different perspective in the smashing short story
&lt;a href="https://qntm.org/mmacevedo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by qntm.
Failing systems engaged fall-backs, resulting in your obsolete brain scan being
yanked from storage to inhabit an advanced humanoid robot, in a facility deep
under the ocean, some time after a comet strike has scoured all life from the
planet's surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that wasn't bad enough, one facilitating technology of this nightmarish
scenario, a black goo that mimics and improves upon electrical and biological
circuitry it comes into contact with, has run rampant, growing probing tendrils
which are wrecking the facility. Among other effects, it has reanimated the
corpses of the last few humans, who skulk around, not in a good way. As our
protagonist asks, incredulously, "You mean they've been brought back to life?".
Our reassuring AI companion replies "Yeah, let's call it that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game borrows the highly effective mechanics of Frictional's previous games,
the Amnesia and Penumbra series, where the proximity of horrific, shambling
enemies causes your character to experience debilitating symptoms, including,
in this case, static-y visual distortions as your neural hardware suffers from
some overload or interference. This applies even if you simply look at an
enemy, an act which immediately draws their attention. So your only chance to
survive encounters is to stay well out of sight, and actively avert your eyes
so you can't even watch what's going on. Not being able to see exactly what
your enemies are, or what they are up to, turns out to be fabulously scary and
atmospheric. At one point it lead directly to my wife catching me staring
intently at a blank, black screen for a prolonged period, with a peculiar
expression on my face, as I hid in a dark cupboard waiting for the slithering
sounds behind me to go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spurring us through this environment are not just threats to our immediate
survival, but also the adoption of a project, to launch into space a
solar-powered simulation, hosting all the last remaining brain scans of the
now-defunct human race, known as the 'ARK'. This will allow the on-board sims
to live a prolonged period of idyllic virtual existence, preserving at least
some echo of what humanity was. Since the conceit of the game is that our
character is a living and conscious entity that feels real emotion, the sims on
the ARK are all presumably the same, so this seems like a worthwhile endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are guided, motivated, and assisted by "Catherine", a simulated personality
running on our hand-held omni-tool, based on the brain recording of an AI
researcher, whose project during her lifetime was the ARK. Plugging her in to a
wall or console socket lets her interface with our surroundings, activating
power supplies and manipulating machinery. She leads us through a series of
undersea facilities, linked by trains, submersibles, and the occasional
disorienting trudge across the murky ocean floor, stirred up by ferocious
currents and landslides, populated by organic-mechanical hybrid horrors that
glide by in the darkness. I found these some of the absolute best, most
atmospheric "walking simulator" moments I've experienced in a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt="The ocean floor, stirred up by currents and landslides" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/soma-murky.webp"&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Is that another distant light up ahead? Good luck finding them while the currents pummel you,
and hideous, deadly beasts loom out of the murk.
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, we encounter a few unforgettable scenarios. We come across the
failing storage system in which the last remaining copy of our own brain scan
resides. I decide to flip some buttons which delete it, prompting my character
to respond with something like "Let this be the last time I wake up in this
godforsaken place."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At another point, we find ourselves trapped within a collapsing facility on the
bottom of the ocean, with the gibbering undead hammering on the door from the
next room. There is an airlock leading out into the ocean, but we would be
crushed at this depth. There is no way out. Luckily, Catherine is able to guide
us into assembling a more robust robot, one capable of withstanding the
pressure - all we have to do is sit in the chair and activate the transfer into
it. We already did this once, back in Toronto. Easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, after the transfer, we glance back across the lab at our original - the
pictured chap with red LED eyes - who, we notice, is still breathing. Asking
Catherine about it, she reminds us that the brain scan is not a destructive
operation. He's still in there, chemically subdued for the moment, but he'll
soon wake up again, wondering why the transfer didn't work. So we are left with
the option of stomping out of the airlock to safety, leaving him behind to his
nightmarish fate. Or flipping a switch to deactivate him before we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of these narrative beats work better as a game than they perhaps might in
a written story. They emphasize the player's complicity, your moral
culpability, which is a mode that games, for all their faults, can do better
than any other media. Plenty of the lesser moments along the way expose the
player to decisions about unplugging some human simulation or other which
declares itself to be "alive", but which is gating your progress in some way.
Some of them are yourself. Some of these acts require manhandling weighty
cables, which require large, insistent tugging with the mouse controls. It's
not just a disembodied button press. One has to provide a determined,
definitive, mechanical input to end a life. In context, the guilt feels real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the journey, we finally stumble across an honest-to-goodness real,
live human being. She describes how the rest of the humans will be gathered in
particular locations, while she stayed to protect the ARK. But, we tell her, we
just passed through those locations, and there were no humans remaining there.
We both know that the planet's surface is sterile. A beat passes before she
announces "So I'm the last human being left alive." She's deathly sick, and
without hope. By the end of your interactions she asks you to turn off her
life-support before you leave, and stay with her for her last wheezing moments.
So this is how humanity ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrying on, because what else is there to do? We finally we get the ARK loaded
into the launch system that delivers it to orbit, upload our brain scans onto
it just before it launches, and - we've done it! Success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a moment, about five minutes before the end, when I realized what was
going to happen here, even though my character had not. It was a real emotional
blow. I envied and pitied him for his naive hope. For believing there was still
a way out. For, of course, the ARK's launch changed nothing for us. Our
simulations are aboard it, but we are still sitting here, in a broken robot
corpse in a collapsing facility at the bottom of a haunted ocean on a dead
planet. The dispatched copy will enjoy life on the ARK, but we - like the copy
of ourselves we left behind earlier - are stuck here for good.

(2017-2019)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;img alt="Spoilers" src="https://tartley.com/files/spoilers.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/Watchmen1987"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a
seminal 12-issue superhero comic by Alan Moore (writer) &amp;amp; Dave Gibbons
(artist), published from 1986 to 1987, that transformed the comics world. A
superhero tale in which all-but-one of the superheroes have no superhuman
powers at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decades since have spawned a number of remakes, sequels, prequels and
spin-offs. Zach Snyder's movie adaptation has its adherents, and the HBO
miniseries sequel was, in my opinion, excellent. But other than that they have
not been very good. I initially thought the 12 issue sequel &lt;em&gt;Doomsday Clock&lt;/em&gt;
comic would fall solidly into this group, and passed it by when it came out
a couple of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on reading it last week, I really enjoyed it. It really swings for the
fences, providing a smashing tale, with good arcs for both old and new
characters, and a genuine attempt to advance the conversation that &lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt;
started by deconstructing the superhero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We last saw Dr Manhattan at the end of &lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt;, having been isolated from
humanity by Adrien Veidt's plans, tired of his entanglement in the messy
complexity of people's lives, threatening to leave the galaxy "for one less
complicated".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt="Manhattan's departure at the end of Watchmen" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/doomsday-clock-watchmen-manhattan.webp"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Doomsday Clock&lt;/em&gt;, Adrian Veidt, genius that he is, invents a means to follow
Dr Manhattan, seeking his help with the re-emergence of imminent nuclear war
brought about by the revelations in Rorschach's journal, and it becomes clear
that the place Dr Manhattan has journeyed to is the DC universe, populated by
Superman, Batman, and the &lt;em&gt;whole&lt;/em&gt; stable of DC heroes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various other &lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt; characters make their way, or are transferred to, the
DC universe. This has been described across the comic industry as "the
crossover event nobody wanted", but personally I felt it was really well done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the most prominently deceased &lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt; characters are brought back
into play, using mechanisms I thought were legitimate and, on occasion,
laugh-out-loud satisfying as they reached their resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt="Doomsday Clock Watchmen Comedian Alive" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/doomsday-clock-comedian.webp"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, they find a way to bring back Rorschach. Or, at least, &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;
Rorschach. Another individual picks up the mask. This seems like the most
controversial of the many decisions in the book, but it's handled deftly, and
there are both similarities and differences between the old and the new
Rorschach, making it an interesting character in its own right. In some ways
this transformation is reminiscent of HBO Watchmen's treatment of Hooded
Justice - retaining everything we already knew about the character, but
performing an astonishing piece of narrative ju-jitsu to utterly transform
everything about what that meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DC heroes slowly realize their world is being altered by Dr Manhattan's
manipulations, tying this crossover into the latest of the DC universe's
"crisis" events, as Manhattan experiments with this reality, in order to
understand it. In doing so, he uncovers deep truths that affect the
inter-relationship between all the DC time-lines and universes, establishing
that historical stories, such as Superman's original appearance in Action
Comics of the 1930s, represent realities that still exist, out in the
multiverse, unaffected by subsequent commercial re-ploughing that forever
drives Superman's origin story further forward in time over the years. All
these worlds, including the various DC pre-crisis worlds, are accessible to
Manhattan's powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, this enables DC to undo the changes wrought by the last few
years' unpopular "New 52" era. This meant nothing to me when I started reading,
I know basically nothing about American comics, only being familiar with the
fabulous British &lt;em&gt;2000AD&lt;/em&gt;. I was spurred into reading around the DC lore, and by
the time I was done, I understood that the &lt;em&gt;New 52&lt;/em&gt; reality included things
like The Justice League's alternate roster, the early death of Clark's parents,
which distances Superman from humanity and changes the character dramatically,
the loss of the Justice Society of America from Earth, and the loss of Wally
West's Flash. All these and more are written off as the effects of Dr
Manhattan's meddling, isolated and preserved in just another spun-off part of
the multiverse, while being jettisoned from the privileged &lt;em&gt;metaverse&lt;/em&gt;, the
core template from which all subsequent multiversal threads are forged, as it
reverts to more-or-less its former state when Manhattan's changes are undone
during &lt;em&gt;Doomsday Clock&lt;/em&gt;'s story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doing all this, Manhattan exhibits his usual clinical detachment from the
human consequences of his actions, setting himself up as the villain of the
piece, an uncaring "being of inaction", in contrast to Superman, the literal
"man of Action" (Action comics, that is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt="Doomsday Clock: Superman &amp;amp; Manhattan" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/doomsday-clock-superman.webp"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This forms a genuine riposte to &lt;em&gt;Watchmen's&lt;/em&gt; criticism of the superhero genre.
Yes, the DC heroes inhabit a simpler world, but there is a mythological power
in what they represent as symbols. Particularly the value of &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt;, as
personified by Superman, which - quite literally, in this tale - makes all
other things possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was especially pleased with the quiet, understated places Doomsday Clock goes
with &lt;em&gt;Mothman's&lt;/em&gt;, back-story. The character in &lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt; was only a punchline,
a recurring throwaway reference to instability and alcoholism, telegraphing his
subsequent mental breakdown. But here, we see him fully fleshed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the rest of the &lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt; heroes, he has no magical superhuman powers,
but is still able to pull off entirely unexpected and superhuman-seeming
stunts, merely by the virtue of his own unique kind of extreme mental and
emotional resourcefulness. Flawed, but aware of his faults, and able to pull it
together, he befriends the younger Rorschach II during their overlapping stays
in a mental institution, becoming a beacon of warmth, kindness, and generosity
to the younger man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He acts as a symbol, if you will, that just as &lt;em&gt;Watchmen's&lt;/em&gt; ruthless gaze
influenced the wider world of comics, so the comic world gazes back. They see
us, all the real-world, fully-rounded humans, trapped in the depths of our
pathos, and they wonder, when will each of us learn to transcend our humdrum
limitations, to act on our hopes and dreams, and &lt;em&gt;fly...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;

&lt;img alt="A laptop" src="https://tartley.com/files/2008/02/lappy.webp"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My employer, Canonical, has a "bring your own hardware" policy, trusting that
their engineers would rather choose and administer their own personal laptops,
rather than put up with standardized remotely administered corporate hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current much loved Thinkpad 460p has served faithfully since 2015, but is
showing its age, sometimes struggling under the workload. Plus, its integrated
graphics chipset doesn't have the power to play modern games with my kiddo.
Battlezone 98 runs fine, but Civilization VI (2016) is annoyingly choppy,
at about 9 frames per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt="Civilization VI screenshot" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/civ-vi.webp"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This summer I received the three-year cash-in-hand bonus earmarked as a
"hardware refresh bonus". It's been many years since I've bought a laptop with
the attention to detail that comes with spending one's own money. Even the
current aging Thinkpad was a gift from a former employer. So it's been a decade
or more since I've seriously specced out a new laptop. This post exists as a
place to scribble down reminders of a few things I learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a few constraints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About the same size as the current Thinkpad's 14 inches, or maybe a tiny bit
  bigger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I work on Ubuntu Linux, so I'll need to check it plays nicely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should support modern gaming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plenty of monitor ports, and/or the grunt to daisy chain them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it too much to ask for a headphone jack in 2022?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability for me to open it up, swap out the battery, drives, RAM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3:2 display would be nice, but these are rare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A budget of $2,000 (saving a bit of my bonus for other hardware-related things.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading around, I got sort-of up to speed on components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CPU&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CPU buzz is around Intel's 12th generation (aka "Alder Lake"). These are
"hybrid" CPUs, combining large high performance cores with smaller high
efficiency cores on a single chip. They come in about 30 different variants,
with a naming convention that looks like, for example: &lt;code&gt;Intel Core i7-12700H&lt;/code&gt;.
This consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A brand, eg. "Intel Core"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A modifier specifying a market segment, one of:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i3 Casual use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i5 Multitasking, light gaming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i7 Gaming, content creators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i9 Slightly faster, more parallel cores.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A single or double digit generation, eg the latest is "12".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An SKU, eg the "700" above, a three or four digit number which roughly
  corresponds to the feature-set or performance - larger is better. These are
  only comparable within a single generation, they adopt wildly different
  conventions in different generations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A single or double letter suffix, eg "H" for "high performance", taken from
  &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000058567/processors/intel-core-processors.html"&gt;an idiotic irregular table&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major alternative to an Intel processor is AMD. These aren't the current
season's darlings of the performance benchmarks, although they do include
several respectable contenders that might be great for my needs, as you can see
in the following performance comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Benchmarks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These laptop CPU performance benchmarks are culled from
&lt;a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/laptop.html"&gt;www.cpubenchmark.net&lt;/a&gt;,
sorted by the benchmark score. I included the top 20, plus a handful of notable
others that I looked up along the way. The 'bench' column measures relative
performance under a variety of benchmark workloads which fully utilize all
cores. The higher this number, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of cores is given as (p)erformance + (e)fficiency, for hybrid processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;CPU&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: left;"&gt;Cores&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice my current Thinkpad's processor at the very bottom of this list, which
is 10x slower than the CPU I ended up getting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Graphics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of otherwise fantastic laptops which don't include blazing
fast dedicated Nvidia or AMD graphics processors, but instead only come with
relatively humdrum graphics support integrated with the CPU. Although
integrated GPUs have improved massively in the last few years, this wouldn't be
fast enough to run modern games well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compensate, I considered pairing such laptops with an external GPU enclosure
(eGPU), into which a top-of-the-line desktop GPU card can be plugged. I'm still
wistfully curious about this path, but in the end opted to do without this
complication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a table of the top laptop GPUs, culled from
&lt;a href="https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/"&gt;gpu.userbenchmark.com&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the CPU table,
this isn't the top N performers, because GPUs can get crazy fast and expensive,
so I'm looking for something middle-of-the-pack. It's just a selection of GPUs
I looked up while researching particular laptop models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 'performance' column is the combined result of a variety of gaming
benchmarks, the higher the better. The 'position' column compares the
performance against all other benchmarked GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the two 'integrated' entries at the bottom of the table, one of which is
my current laptop, a full 20x slower than the GPU I ended up getting. The
improvement ought to speed Civilization VI up to around an entirely excessive
180 frames per second. \o/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Laptop models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the above in mind, I read some reviews, and a few contenders emerged:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Framework&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Framework was massively tempting. It brings an entirely unprecedented
- some might hopefully say &lt;em&gt;revolutionary&lt;/em&gt; - focus on user-repair and
upgradability. Rather than soldering and gluing the whole thing together,
all the Framework's components, up to and including the motherboard and
screen, are replaceable using a single screwdriver. This is deeply appealing
for geeks, who want to be able to repair or upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside that gave me pause is it is only available with integrated
Intel-powered graphics. If they had a model including the vastly superior
Nvidia or AMD accelerated graphics, I would have just bought one months ago,
instead of prevaricating. But that complication, coupled with the fact that the
Framework's performance is only mid-range for a 2022 model, put me off
sufficiently to look around at other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dell XPS 13 plus&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dell XPS 13 plus looks wonderful, with official Ubuntu verification, no
less, but just isn't physically big enough for me, and is noticeably
underpowered. And the Dell 15 inch models seem way overpriced, for the spec,
easily exceeding my $2,000 budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;HP Dev One&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HP Dev One looks like a fabulous machine, a colleague just got one and is
very happy with it. But again, it only has integrated graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Mac Book Pro&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I considered this, repaved to run Ubuntu, of course, but to be honest, as
exquisite as the hardware was at one point, it seems somewhat stagnant and
directionless now, fifteen years later. Not unimpressive, but doesn't really
grab me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;System76&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at a whole bunch of other laptops at this point, scouring the "best
gaming laptops of 2022" lists at Toms Hardware and elsewhere. Eventually my
attention was drawn to System76, who, on reflection, should have been folks I
checked out earlier in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oryx is just a few hundred over my budget, even with the current $300 off.
But a tricked-out Gazelle seems to check all the boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt='Gazelle 15" laptop' src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/gazelle-15.avif"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have a reasonably high-ranked 12th generation Intel i7 CPU, which seems
to achieve good performance without wading into the diminishing returns
of pricey i9 models. Same for the reasonably-placed Nvidia 3060 graphics. And
the screen is just magic (judged by my admittedly idiosyncratic personal
criteria.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They support the lightning fast open source &lt;a href="https://www.coreboot.org"&gt;coreboot
firmware&lt;/a&gt;, and System76 are a leading contributor to
the project. They sell with Linux-pre-installed, and produce their own
Ubuntu-based Linux distribution, Pop!_OS (Although stock Ubuntu runs just fine
too.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going with Nvidia graphics instead of AMD does yield a performance boost, but
the downside is that I'll have to wrestle with the opaque proprietary drivers
from the famously uncooperative Nvidia. But in a nice gesture, System76
&lt;a href="https://support.system76.com/articles/graphics-switch-ubuntu"&gt;documents this
process&lt;/a&gt;, and
lots of other stuff, such as how to replace internal components yourself, on
their website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it's proprietary closed source, Nvidia drivers have always lagged
behind AMD's open source offerings in terms of compatibility. In particular,
Nvidia graphics hasn't worked with the new Linux Wayland display server.
Reading around, my impression is that it's not ready yet, but &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be by
22.10 (which is next month!?), so I could stick with the older XOrg display
server for now, without fearing that I'll get marooned there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other downsides. The keyboard is reputedly mediocre, and I wish it
didn't have a numpad. Standard layout tenkeyless for the win, every time. But I
almost always use a USB mechanical keyboard anyhow. Also, with such greedy
components, the battery life kinda sucks when the GPU is on and the machine is
busy. But in the last 12 months, the only time I've run my current laptop not
plugged in is... never? So I guess I don't care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="https://system76.com/laptops/gazelle#specs"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;is what I ordered, with
the 15" display and the 3060 graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I did that thing where I order it with minimal RAM and SSD storage, to
replace with my own parts. So I'll have some screwdriver work to do after it
arrives. The payoff is that I save about $150 by paying market rates for these
components. In fact I already have a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-SN850-Internal-Gaming-Solid/dp/B0B7CPSN2K"&gt;tremendous
SSD&lt;/a&gt;
I can use, leftover from this year's Chia cryptocurrency farming experiments,
so that part is free. This means I can stay within my $2,000 budget, with $9 to
spare after shipping and taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Memory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's generally fine to just buy whatever RAM is recommended by your vendor.
But the most reliable and cheapest memory will often be the slowest, or at least
the one running at a clock speed which is most widely supported by different
motherboards. In order to get the &lt;em&gt;fastest&lt;/em&gt; memory for our particular laptop, we
need to understand a few things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Physical form factor&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current standard for RAM is DDR4. For laptops, the slim physical form
factor is known as SoDIMM. A single circuit board of memory chips is a
&lt;em&gt;module&lt;/em&gt;. A module connects into a motherboard &lt;em&gt;slot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DDR5 is supported by Intel's 12th generation processors, and AMD's newest Ryzen
7000 series. This uses a different physical connection on the motherboard, and
is rare thus far, outside of systems above my budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm looking for DDR4 in a SoDIMM module. Got it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ranks &amp;amp; Channels&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A module contains from one to eight 64-bit wide logical &lt;em&gt;blocks&lt;/em&gt; of data storage
(single, dual, quad or octal &lt;em&gt;rank&lt;/em&gt;.) The chips on a module provide x1, x2, x4
or x8 &lt;em&gt;banks&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;number of chips x chip banks / 64 = module rank
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;eg. Using sixteen x4 chips will provide a single rank of memory on the module
(16x4/64=1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas using 32 x8 chips will provide a module of 4 ranks (32x8/64=4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is sometimes annotated on the module using a notation like 1Rx4, as in one
rank of x4 chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason this matters is that access to ranks is interleaved, so multiple
ranks can provide access to data at multiples of the rate provided by a single
rank. In order to take advantage of this, the motherboard must provide a
commensurate number of memory access &lt;em&gt;channels&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The
&lt;a href="https://tech-docs.system76.com/models/gaze17/README.html"&gt;datasheet for my Gazelle&lt;/a&gt;
says the motherboard has two memory slots, and supports dual-channel access.
This could be fully utilized by either inserting a single dual-rank module
(which is more expensive), or, as in the timeworn heuristic, by inserting two
half-sized single rank modules (e.g. two 16GB modules to make 32GB total.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Clock frequencies and latency&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAM has a clock frequency, measured in thousands of MHz, but "double data rate"
chips transfer data on both the clock's rising and falling edges, so the speed
of transfer is better measured in mega-transfers per second (MT/s), the higher
the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it takes more than one clock cycle to perform an action. These latency
values are sometimes quoted as a series of four integers - the number of clock
cycles to perform particular operations, e.g. 18-18-18-43. But these are often
abbreviated to just the first number, representing read access time, known as
"CAS Latency" (CL), eg. CL 18, which tends to be representative. The lower this
number is, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual performance of the memory is determined by the product of a clock
cycle duration (eg. 1ns at 1000MHz) and the latency number (e.g. 1ns * 18 =
18ns)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the motherboard needs to support the RAM's clock speed. In practice,
the motherboard will negotiate with the inserted modules to find a commonly
supported frequency, the same or less than the minimum of the rated memory
access frequencies of the module, the motherboard, and the CPU, using an
over-complicated and hard-to-predict process controlled by BIOS settings. I
have no experience with this but it sounds well worth avoiding altogether by
making sure we get modules with a rated frequency that exactly matches the
advertised clock frequency of our motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my new Gazelle,
&lt;a href="https://tech-docs.system76.com/models/gaze17/README.html"&gt;the manual&lt;/a&gt;
says that is 3,200MHz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Availability, pricing and scams.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding CL26 latency RAM at 3,200MHz is easy, for around $70. For lower
latencies the price goes up to about $375 for CL16, but that isn't even in
stock anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, after much searching, I found some CL16 on newegg.com:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Memory on sale in Newegg - scam" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/memory-on-sale.webp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is only $128! Carefully checking the specs, including those on the
manufacturer's site, using the shown model number 'CMSX32GX4M2A3000C16',
this is exactly what we want. 2x16GB at 3200MT/s at CL16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While checking it out, I clicked around a bit, and at one point found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bad review on Newegg" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/bad-review-on-newegg.webp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This came along with a number of other negative reviews, stating customers had
been sent memory modules that were fake, ie. imitations of the purported
reputable manufacturer, they didn't work at the advertised clock speeds, and
the seller had gone dark on them, taking weeks to respond to queries, and not
sending replacements until Newegg got involved. Seems wisest to skip this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I found an alternative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Memory on sale in Newegg - legit" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/memory-on-sale-legit.webp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! DDR4 in a SoDIMM package, 2x16GB modules at 3,200MHz and 18CL. The latency
isn't quite as good, but it sounds legit, so I'll take it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that, I'm done. Now just awaiting the deliveries to arrive...&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>hardware</category><category>journal</category><category>linux</category><guid>https://tartley.com/posts/new-laptop-time/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2022 16:59:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Neuromancer</title><link>https://tartley.com/posts/neuromancer/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float: left; padding: 1em;"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by William Gibson, 1984.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So opens William Gibson's debut novel, and it is to his eternal credit that we
all still remember the line now, nearly forty years later. I don't usually do
audiobooks, but I made an exception for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bartenderâs smile widened. His ugliness was the stuff of legend. In an
age of affordable beauty, there was something heraldic about his lack of it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the majority of the beloved science fiction of my youth, Gibson's
poetic, literary style has only increased in my estimation over the subsequent
decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of
legitimate operators, in every nation. By children, being taught mathematical
concepts. A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every
computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged
in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city
lights, receding.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consensual hallucination might seem prosaic now, but one has to remember
this was written back when the internet connected less than 1,000 hosts,
accessed via green screen text terminals on university campuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He'd made the classic mistake, the one he'd sworn he'd never make. He stole
from his employers. [...] Of course he was welcome, they told him, welcome
to the money. And he was going to need it. Because â still smiling
â they were going to make sure he never worked again. They damaged his
nervous system with a wartime Russian mycotoxin. Strapped to a bed in a
Memphis hotel, his talent burning out micron by micron, he hallucinated for
thirty hours. The damage was minute, subtle, and utterly effective. For Case,
who lived for the bodiless exultation of cyberspace, it was the Fall. In the
bars he'd frequented as a cowboy hotshot, the elite stance involved a certain
relaxed contempt for the flesh. The body was meat. Case fell into the prison
of his own flesh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He introduced the world to cyberpunk, combining the fatalistic noire of Blade
Runner with the relentless dehumanizing advances of a libertarian tech
dystopia, to create a startlingly original warning of our possible future that
looks, as the decades tumble by, increasingly on-the-nose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A year here and he still dreamed of cyberspace, hope fading nightly. All the
speed he took, all the turns he'd taken and the corners he cut in Night City,
and he'd still see the matrix in his dreams, bright lattices of logic
unfolding across that colourless void... The Sprawl was a long, strange way
home now over the Pacific, and he was no console man, no cyberspace cowboy.
Just another hustler, trying to make it through. But the dreams came on in
the Japanese night like livewire voodoo, and he'd cry for it, cry in his
sleep, and wake alone in the dark, curled in his capsule in some coffin
hotel, hands clawed into the bedslab, temper foam bunched between his
fingers, trying to reach the console that wasn't there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several versions of Neuromancer as an audiobook. The slightly
abridged six-hour version &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/NeuromancerReadByWilliamGibson"&gt;available for free at the Internet
Archive&lt;/a&gt; is notable
for two things: it is read by William Gibson himself, and it is an extremely
low quality rip from an audiocassette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Night City wasnât there for its inhabitants, but as a deliberately
unsupervised playground for technology itself. Like a deranged experiment in
social Darwinism, designed by a bored researcher who kept one thumb
permanently on the fast-forward button. Biz here was a constant subliminal
hum, and death the accepted punishment for laziness, carelessness, lack of
grace, failure to heed the demands of an intricate protocol.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audio quality might make anyone immediately pass this version by. It isn't
just noisy, but features discernible wow and flutter - artifacts characteristic
of the stretching or uneven speed of its original tape based media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He closed his eyes. Found the ridged face of the power stud. And in the
bloodlit dark behind his eyes, silver phosphenes boiled in from the edge of
space, hypnagogic images jerking past like a film compiled of random frames.
Symbols, figures, faces, a blurred, fragmented mandala of visual information.
Please, he prayed, now- A gray disk, the color of Chiba sky. Now- Disk
beginning to rotate, faster, becoming a sphere of paler gray. Expanding- And
flowed, flowered for him, fluid neon origami trick, the unfolding of
distanceless home, his country, transparent 3D chessboard extending to
infinity. Inner eye opening to the stepped scarlet pyramid of the Eastern
Seaboard Fission Authority burning beyond the green cubes of Mitsubishi Bank
of America, and high and very far away he saw the spiral arms of the military
systems, forever beyond his reach. And somewhere he was laughing, in a
white-painted loft, distant fingers caressing the deck, tears of release
streaking his face.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I'd urge you to stick with it. For the author's reedy, Virginia-inflected
voice has a cadence that holds the attention. A rhythm of tone and emphasis
that, for me, works considerably better than the practiced glossiness of more
recent, more professional recordings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The moment, I mean the nanosecond, that one of those things starts figuring
out ways to make itself smarter, Turingâll wipe it. Nobody trusts those
fuckers, you know that. Every AI ever built has an electromagnetic shotgun
wired to its forehead."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the second chapter, I'd stopped being bothered by the audio
quality, and by chapter three, it had become an intrinsic part of the
experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was disturbing to think of the Flatline as a construct, a hardwired ROM
cassette replicating a dead man's skills, obsessions, kneejerk responses.&lt;br&gt;
[...]&lt;br&gt;
He slotted some ice, connected the construct, and jacked in.
It was exactly the sensation of someone reading over his shoulder.
He coughed.&lt;br&gt;
  "Dix? McCoy? That you man?' His throat was tight.&lt;br&gt;
"Hey, bro," said a directionless voice.&lt;br&gt;
"It's Case, man. Remember?"&lt;br&gt;
"Miami, joeboy, quick study."&lt;br&gt;
"What's the last thing you remember before I spoke to you, Dix?"&lt;br&gt;
"Nothin'."&lt;br&gt;
"Hang on." He disconnected the construct. The presence was gone. He reconnected it. "Dix? Who am I?"&lt;br&gt;
"You got me hung, Jack. Who the fuck are you?"&lt;br&gt;
"Remember being here, a second ago?"&lt;br&gt;
"No."&lt;br&gt;
"Know how a ROM personality matrix works?"&lt;br&gt;
"Sure, bro, it's a firmware construct."&lt;br&gt;
"So I jack it into the bank I'm using, I can give it sequential, real time memory?"&lt;br&gt;
"Guess so," said the construct.&lt;br&gt;
"Okay, Dix. You &lt;b&gt;are&lt;/b&gt; a ROM construct. Got me?"&lt;br&gt;
"If you say so," said the construct. "Who are you?"&lt;br&gt;
"Case."&lt;br&gt;
"Miami," said the voice, "joeboy, quick study."&lt;br&gt;
"Right. And for starts, Dix, you and me, we're gonna sleaze over to London grid and access a little data. You game for that?"&lt;br&gt;
"You gonna tell me I got a choice, boy?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A distortion so thoroughly appropriate to the underlying material
it was as though Gibson had planned it this way all along, speaking directly to
me via a weak signal, projected through time by the noisy filters of this
obsolete electro-mechanical recording mechanism. The words at once clear and
irrevocably decayed, fuzzy sounding but still stark and unmistakable in their
meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Dixie?"&lt;br&gt;
"Yeah."&lt;br&gt;
"You ever try to crack an AI?"&lt;br&gt;
"Sure. I flatlined. First time. I was larkin', jacked up real high, out by Rio heavy commerce sector. Big biz, multinationals, Government of Brazil lit up like a Christmas tree. Just larkin' around, you know? And then I started picking up on this one cube, maybe three levels higher up. Jacked up there and made a pass."&lt;br&gt;
"What did it look like, the visual?"&lt;br&gt;
"White cube."&lt;br&gt;
"How'd you know it was an AI?"&lt;br&gt;
"How'd I know? Jesus. It was the densest ice I'd ever seen. So what else was it? The military down there don't have any thing like that. Anyway, I jacked out and told my computer to look it up."&lt;br&gt;
"Yeah?"&lt;br&gt;
"It was on the Turing Registry. AI. Frog company owned its Rio mainframe."&lt;br&gt;
Case chewed his lower lip and gazed out across the plateaus of the Eastern Seaboard Fission Authority, into the infinite neuroelectronic void of the matrix. "Tessier-Ashpool, Dixie?"&lt;br&gt;
"Tessier, yeah."&lt;br&gt;
"And you went back?"&lt;br&gt;
"Sure. I was crazy. Figured I'd try to cut it. Hit the first strata and that's all she wrote. My joeboy smelled the skin frying and pulled the trodes off me. Mean shit, that ice."&lt;br&gt;
"And your EEG was flat."&lt;br&gt;
"Well, that's the stuff of legend, ain't it?'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five out of five stars. A riveting performance.&lt;/p&gt;

quiz this week, and my default way of learning something is to organize the information
into an essay. Not the best work I've ever done, but it got me through the
test, so good enough. Some of these assertions seem somewhat debatable, but my
job here is to learn what the test tells me are the right answers. In some
places I've elaborated around the edges with extra info that isn't on the test,
but helps me to contextualize and remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The region now occupied by the US was originally settled by Native Americans,
probably travelling from the Far East, around 15,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern Native tribes include Apache, Arawak, Blackfeet, Cherokee, Cheyenne,
Chippewa, Choctaw, Creek, Crow, Hopi, Huron, Inuit, Iroquois, Lakota, Mohegan,
Navajo, Oneida, Pueblo, Seminole, Shawnee, Sioux, and Teton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European colonists came to America to escape persecution, in pursuit of religious
and political freedom, and economic opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic slave trade took Africans to the American colonies as slaves. This
practice was widespread by the time of the American Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colonists decided to fight for freedom from British rule because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They didn't want to pay high taxes to the British government without representation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They did not like the British army being quartered in their houses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They wanted self-government.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time of the declaration of independence, there were thirteen colonies that
became the initial thirteen United States:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connecticut&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delaware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Georgia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maryland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Jersey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New York&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;North Carolina&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;South Carolina&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virginia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These States fought the American Revolutionary War against Great Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1803 (27 years after the declaration of independence), the United States
bought the Louisiana territory from France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Founding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Declaration of Independence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Declaration of Independence&lt;/em&gt; declared the United States to be independent
of, and free from, the rule of Great Britain. It was written by Thomas
Jefferson, and adopted on July 4th, 1776.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It notes the right of all men to enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The American Constitution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supreme law of the land is the &lt;em&gt;constitution&lt;/em&gt;. It sets up and defines the
government, and also enumerates the basic rights of American citizens and
residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of self-government is represented in the constitution's first three
words: "&lt;em&gt;We the people...&lt;/em&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The constitution was written at the &lt;em&gt;constitutional convention&lt;/em&gt; of 1787, by
the &lt;em&gt;Founding Fathers&lt;/em&gt;. Its passage was supported by the Federalist Papers,
written by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay, under the pseudonym
"&lt;em&gt;Publius&lt;/em&gt;", after &lt;em&gt;Publius Valerius Poplicola&lt;/em&gt;, a Roman aristocrat who led the
overthrow of the monarchy to found the Roman Republic in 509 BC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Franklin is known as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oldest member of the constitutional convention,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first Postmaster General of the United States,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writer of "Poor Richard's Almanac",&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starter of the first free libraries,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A US diplomat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Washington is known as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first President&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The "Father of our Country"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original text of the constitution has since been modified by twenty-seven
&lt;em&gt;amendments&lt;/em&gt;, each of which is numbered, and takes the form of an addition to
the existing text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rights and Responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first ten amendments are known as &lt;em&gt;"the Bill of Rights"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first amendment prohibits the government from infringing on the right of
residents in the US to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish or practice any religion, or no religion at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free speech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freedom of the press.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peaceably assemble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Petition the government for a redress of grievances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final four items above are together known as "freedom of expression".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the constitution establishes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The right to bear arms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US citizens are granted additional rights that do not apply to all residents,
including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running for federal office&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voting in federal elections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And US citizens are additionally assigned responsibilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jury service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voting in federal elections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voting in federal elections is thus established as both a right and a
responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pledge of allegiance declares loyalty to the US flag and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ways for citizens to participate in their democracy include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join a political party&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help with a political campaign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join a civic or community group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give opinions to elected officials, such as calling Senators or Representatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publicly support or oppose an issue or policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run for office&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write to a newspaper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When becoming a naturalized US citizen, the oath of allegiance declares one will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give up loyalty to other countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be loyal to the United States&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obey the laws of the United States&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defend the constitution and laws of the United States&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serve in the US military (if the law demands it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serve civil projects for the nation (if the law demands it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All men resident in the USA must register for &lt;em&gt;selective service&lt;/em&gt; (a list from which
draftees are chosen should the need arise) between the ages of 18 and 26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last day to submit federal income tax forms is April 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Voting rights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enfranchisement and disenfranchisement of different groups has been a
moral and political issue throughout United States history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original constitution did not explicitly specify who was able to vote,
and states demonstrated considerable diversity in whom they did or did not grant
suffrage to. In particular, most states only granted the vote to white, male,
property owners - about 6% of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1820s, attitudes and state laws shifted, to allow all white males to
vote in most states, although some laws removing the poor's right to vote
continued until the 20th century, and practices that disproportionately
affect the poor's ability to vote continue today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several constitutional amendments successively modified who can vote,
notably:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 15th Amendment of 1870, in the wake of the Civil War and Emancipation
  Proclamation, prevented the denial of voting rights based on a person's race.
  This was effectively interpreted to mean that &lt;em&gt;men&lt;/em&gt; (not women) of any race
  could vote. However, states continued to prevent the majority of African
  Americans in the United States from voting, via Jim Crow laws, poll taxes,
  literacy tests, grandfather clauses and the like. Only later in the 20th
  century were these laws ruled unconstitutional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 19th Amendment of 1920 allowed women to vote. However, in practice, women
  â who were rarely in control of independent sources of income â
  were usually still prevented from voting by the same discriminatory practices
  that prevented voting by poor or non-white men. For example, federal laws
  preventing banks from denying women to hold bank accounts were not passed
  until 1960. (France was a trailblazer in this, passing equivalent laws in
  1881, while the UK trailed, at 1975.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 24th amendment of 1964 prohibited using a poll tax to control who could
  vote in federal elections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 26th amendment of 1971 lowered the voting age from 21 to 18. This was
  passed in response to Vietnam War protest, which noted that if draftees were
  considered old enough to be sent to fight, they should also be old enough to
  vote.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following section was not part of the USCIS civics test. But I'm including it
because it's clear that although the Declaration asserted "all men are created
equal", subsequent laws and behavior has severely curtailed that assertion when it
comes to issues such as being allowed to vote. So, who currently is, and is
not, allowed to vote? Sometimes the best way to understand something is to
trace its contours, by enumerating the exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who are currently legally denied the right to vote, for reasons that seem
potentially reasonable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those aged under 18.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those deemed mentally "incapacitated" or "incompetent" by a conservatorship
  process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Illegal or undocumented immigrants (16 million people).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following people are also legally denied the vote, for reasons that I personally
find unreasonable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US Citizens and nationals who reside in the United States territories that are
  not States, such as Puerto Rico.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washington DC residents (718,000 people) have had the right to vote in
  presidential elections since 1961, but no congressional elections have been
  held there since 1801.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-citizen residents of the United States such as myself (13 million
  people). This includes legal aliens in good standing, such as foreign
  spouses, asylum claimants and refugees, who might reside within the US,
  paying taxes, for years or decades. Contrast this with the United Kingdom,
  for example, where people in the similar category "with leave to remain" &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;
  able to vote.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The homeless (580,000 people) are often excluded from voting by residency
  requirements, or by the inability to register without a mailing address or proof
  of identity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current prisoners, in almost all states (5.5 million people). Some states
  impose a lifelong denial of voting rights to anyone with a previous felony
  record, which affects another 5.9 million people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US Citizens who have never established residence in the United States may be
  denied the vote by various states.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above categories represent 28.8 million people, around 11 percent of
the adult population, who currently have no legal right to vote for US government
positions due to reasons I personally find controversial or wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Activists&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan B Anthony was a prominent activist for womens rights and civil rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Luther King Jr. fought for civil rights, to try and provide equality for
Americans of all races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States has waged many wars, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;18th Century Wars&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;American Revolutionary War to free America from British rule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cherokee-American wars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Northwest Indian War&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quasi-War (a naval war, allied with Britain, against France &amp;amp; Guadeloupe)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;19th Century Wars&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;56 official wars, mostly resulting in the genocide or internment of various
indigenous Native American nations. Sometimes the United States was allied with
or fighting against Great Britain, and sometimes on the soil of other foes such
as the Ottoman Empire and Morocco, China, Mexico, Spanish Florida, the
Philippines, Cuba, Puerto Rico, or Guam. Notable among these wars were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The War of 1812 against Great Britain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Mexican-American war, in the disputed former Mexican territories of
  Texas, New Mexico, California and regions of Mexico.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The American Civil War.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Spanish-American war.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Civil War&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Civil War of 1861 to 1865 was fought between the United States and
the Confederacy of Southern States, over the issues of whether slavery was to
remain legal in the Southern States, upon which many southern white livelihoods
and businesses depended. This is sometimes framed as an academic disagreement about
"States Rights" to self-government, but I personally find it hard to interpret
that as anything other than a disingenuous fig leaf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham Lincoln lead the Northern states to victory in the Civil War, and is praised
for saving or preserving the Union. He presided over the Emancipation
Proclamation which ostensibly freed the slaves, although many still suffer from
ongoing repercussions and outright racism even up to the present day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;20th Century Wars&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;31 official wars, some against outstanding Native American nations, others in
diverse locations such as Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Russia,
Mongolia, Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Lebanon, Cambodia, Grenada, Libya, Iran &amp;amp;
Persian Gulf, Panama, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Somalia, Bosnia,
Herzegovina, Croatia, Haiti, and Serbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable amongst these were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;World War I, during which the president was Woodrow Wilson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;World War II, against Germany, Japan and Italy, during which the president
  was Franklin D. Roosevelt. Eisenhower was a general in this war, and
  subsequently went on to become President.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Korean War&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persian Gulf War&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Cold war, the main concern of the United States was, it says here,
communism. I'd wonder whether 'mutually assured destruction' might be a
contender, but that is not listed as a correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;21st Century Wars&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 11th September 2001, terrorists attacked the United States by crashing
commercial passenger airliners into the Pentagon in Virginia near Washington
DC, and the twin towers of the World Trade Center, destroying them and killing
nearly 3,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This atrocity was used as a pretext for the USA's subsequent wars in Afghanistan
and Iraq, both of which ended disasterously. The USA has also engaged in 9 other
wars thus far this century, including Libya, Somalia &amp;amp; Syria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Government&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The constitution grants the federal government power to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Print money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Declare war.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raise an army.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make treaties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The states are granted power to provide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protection in the form of police.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire departments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schooling and education.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Driver's licenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zoning and land use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government defined by the constitution is divided into three branches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The executive branch is formed by the President and their administration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The legislative branch is formed by Congress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The judicial branch is formed by the courts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The separation of powers between these three branches forms a system of checks
and balances that prevents any one part of government from becoming too
powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Executive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The President leads the executive branch. They sign bills into law, and have
veto power over new laws. They are the Commander in Chief of the military.
Presidents are elected for four year terms, in a vote that takes place in
November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The President appoints a Cabinet of advisors. If the President cannot serve,
succession falls to the Vice President, and then to the Speaker of the House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other cabinet-level positions include Attorney General, and Secretaries of
Agriculture, Commerce, Defence, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services,
Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, the Interior, Labor,
State, Transportation, the Treasury, and Veterans Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The President is currently Joseph Robinette Biden Jr (Democratic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vice President is currently Kamala Harris (Democratic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Speaker of the House is currently Nancy Pelosi (Democratic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Legislature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress makes federal laws. It comprises two parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Senate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The House of Representatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Senate&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate comprises two senators from each state, yielding 100 total senators.
Each senator represents the entirety of their state. Senators are elected
for six year terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The House of Representatives&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each state is divided into a number of &lt;em&gt;congressional districts&lt;/em&gt;, the number
of which depends on the population of the state. Each district sends a single
representative to the House, whose job is to represent the people of their
specific district. Currently, this yields a total of 435 representatives.
Representatives are elected for two year terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Judicial branch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The courts review and explain laws, resolves disputes, and decides whether
laws contravene the constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "rule of law" states that every individual, no matter how highly-placed,
must obey the law, as must the government itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highest court in the land is the Supreme Court, which comprises nine
justices, lead by Chief Justice John Glover Roberts Jr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;States, Territories, and Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States of America contains 335 million people, of whom around 261
million are adults. The regions of the country comprise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50 States (the 48 &lt;em&gt;contiguous&lt;/em&gt; States, plus Hawaii and Alaska)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washington DC, the capital city and federal district (690,000 people).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus other territories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;American Samoa (43,000 people).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guam (169,000 people).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Northern Mariana Islands (56,000 people).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Puerto Rico (3,286,000 people).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;United States Virgin Islands (87,000 people).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, the least populated state, Wyoming, contains 581,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pacific Ocean is on the West Coast of the United States, while the Atlantic
ocean is on the East Coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two longest rivers within the United States are the Missouri and the Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Statue of Liberty is on Liberty Island, in New York Harbour, on the Hudson River
near the south end of Manhattan in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;States that border Canada are: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;States that border Mexico are: California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flag has 50 stars to represent the 50 states, and 13 stripes to represent the
initial 13 colonies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The national anthem is &lt;em&gt;The Star-Spangled Banner&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independence Day is celebrated every July 4th. Other national holidays are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Year's Day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Martin Luther King Jr. Day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presidents' Day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memorial Day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Independence Day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Labor Day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Columbus Day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Veterans Day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanksgiving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christmas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My State, Minnesota&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capital of Minnesota is St Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current Governor of Minnesota is Tim Waltz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current senators for Minnesota are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amy Klobuchar (Democratic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tina Smith (Democratic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current representative for my district, the first congressional district of
Minnesota, is Jim Hagadorn (Republican).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Miscellanea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economic system of the United States is a capitalist, free market economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two major political parties in the US are the Democratic and Republican
parties.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://tartley.com/posts/basic-us-civics/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jul 2022 16:19:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Journey</title><link>https://tartley.com/posts/journey/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/journey-screenshot.webp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Released on PlayStation 3 by thatgamecompany in 2012. Played on Windows 10 in
2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slow-paced opening scenes, alternately trudging up and then surfing down
sunbaked desert dunes, failed to sustain Zander's interest, so I ended up
playing through its short runtime by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways it's an indictment of videogame culture that ten years later it
still feels so fresh and radical to pair players up with another internet
rando, while giving them no means to communicate or interact other than helping
each other out, either leading by example, or exchanging wordless shouts. It
seems like a pretty limited repertoire at first. I'm half tempted to just wander
off ahead, alone, into the endless desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, you realize that standing close enough together recharges each other's
magical flying scarves. Suddenly, it's enough. You cling to each other for dear
life through the howling storms, double back to rescue each other from prowling
beasts, and then fly exuberantly above the sunlit clouds, forever curving back
to seek each other's life-giving sustenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know who the two internet randos were, with whom I shared the first and
second halves of my journey. But in those minutes together, we lived a
lifetime's worth.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>completed</category><category>media</category><category>videogame</category><category>windows</category><guid>https://tartley.com/posts/journey/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 11:22:20 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Expanse</title><link>https://tartley.com/posts/the-expanse/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The Expanse screencap" src="https://tartley.com/files/2022/the-expanse-screencap.webp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This post rescues content from
&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/mfoord/posts/10158389841835880?comment_id=10158390351245880I"&gt;a Facebook comment&lt;/a&gt; I got carried away with recently.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's so much to write about the Expanse. It's such a relief to find a
science fiction show with an ambitiously futuristic setting depicted in a way
that doesn't make scientifically literate people cringe and shout at the
television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it shines at taking the time for quiet moments of character work, from
Miller's lonely, poignant realization in s01 that he wasn't the talented
office maverick, just incompetent and unreliable, right up to the quiet,
unseen payoff of Naomi's years-long efforts to save her son from his father's
influence, in the final seconds of s06.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On many axes, it's the best SF on television, which is saying something, as
there are so many competitors. Science fiction output is following some sort
of Moore's law of endless expansion, in response to society's need for
mythic stories of relevance to modern life, itself a symptom of the meaning
crisis of modern society. But this is a mixed blessing, because the resulting
shows &amp;amp; movies are often drawn to using the superficial trappings of science
fiction, spaceships and lasers (pew pew!), while failing to fulfil the deeper
psychological needs of mythical or symbolic significance that brought about
their creation. The Expanse is perhaps the prime example of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tartley.com/posts/the-expanse/damiengwalter.com"&gt;My fantastic SF podcast guy&lt;/a&gt; defines SF as the arena in
which we forge new myths of psychological meaning for modern life, which are
sorely needed as traditional myths dwindle in relevance, as they are
predominantly based on nature and superstition. Movements such as spiritual
atheism are a reflection that even the least spiritual amongst us recognize
that something is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do concede that defining SF in this way is a bit of a cheat. It's somewhat
aggrandizing, claiming any great mythic work as actually being part of the
SF genre, an no doubt is a somewhat defensive reaction to mainstream
dismissal of science fiction as puerile. But it does provide a marvellous
framework for discussion, and adopting this definition makes several
previously puzzling things fall into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It settles the revealing, never-ending debates over which works are, and
are not, science fiction. Somewhat tellingly, to me, such debates are
irreconcilable precisely because of the misnomer "science fiction", which was
never really about the science to begin with, as this style of fiction has
existed long before science was the focus. It only gravitated towards using
science as it became apparent that is now where society's power and
transformation springs from - our incarnation of gods and magic - and the name
"science fiction" was then applied post-facto, missing the underlying fact
that this is just mythic fiction with some modern attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This definition perfectly explains things like how the first half of the movie
"Sunshine" could be such astonishing science-fiction, while the second half
- set aboard the exact same spaceship - is just a mediocre slasher flick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. SF is the arena within which we construct new mythic narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this I mean that great science fiction tends to create a story that
resonates because it leans on powerful mythic tropes - symbolic
representations of psychological significance, character arcs mirroring
Jungian archetypes, thematic elements that are told allegorically, suggesting
things to the reader/watcher on a level that can be more powerful than merely
stating them directly to the conscious mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, all-time-great examples such as &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; (the
title being conscious of this mythic entanglement) leans heavily into themes
such as humanity watched over by an ancient, mysterious, godlike alien
influence which has literally created humanity in its present form, and
observes as we now reach a second inflection point, materializing not
just a tale of personal transcendence (although it is certainly that), but one
of species-wide sublimation - suggesting that it is time for us all to reach
spiritual adulthood, to graduate to whatever comes next, to meet and be
transformed by the wise and powerful force that has shepherded humanity
through our previous prehistorical transitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on with similar examples, but will just briefly mention the original
Matrix movie, which is a story which resonates because it is absolutely soaked
in allegory of both religious transcendence and Jungian archetypes - which are
so on-the-nose that it cannot possibly be accidental, a fact acknowledged
directly by the creators in the sequels, when they depict the Architect,
ultimate villain encountered at the narrative peak of the story, as a prim,
middle aged, white bearded gentleman, wearing an Edwardian suit. He speaks in a
precise, almost Germanic manner. This is, unmistakably, Sigmund Freud. Why is
Freud the villain of the Matrix? Because Freud was a contemporaneous antagonist
to Jung, resisting Jung's ideas of self actualization through reconciliation of
the archetypes, just as the Architect resists Neo's progression along that same
path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be my own lack of imagination, but compared to examples like this, the
Expanse starts to look a bit thin. I don't see any symbolism or allegory.
There is some good character work but no actual arcs of transcendence. Through
the unfortunate realities of converting books to screen, large chunks of what
could have been the most meaningful story were simply abandoned and will
apparently never be finished on the screen. In their stead, what would have
been mythic elements become a series of "McGuffin of the week", as we never
circle back to resolve why the protomolecule was created, why it was sent to
our ancient solar system, why it turns people into nuclear-powered zombies,
and what force destroyed the protomolecule creators, and why? And that's just
series one's unresolved elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, lacking that, what the Expanse has to offer is its superlative
world-building and sane, believable depictions of a gritty interplanetary
future. Which is no small feat - arguably nobody else has done it better. But,
for me, it isn't enough. Maybe that's just because I'm a godless heathen who
looks to get my spiritual fix through TV shows about spaceships. Or maybe it's
because science fiction is where we show ourselves what we're capable of, what
to aim for, and I believe we can aim higher than just exciting technological
dystopias.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>fiction</category><category>media</category><category>science-fiction</category><category>tv</category><guid>https://tartley.com/posts/the-expanse/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2022 19:42:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://tartley.com/posts/contact/</link><dc:creator>Jonathan Hartley</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float: left"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Carl Sagan, 1985.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put this into my library queue as it's highly regarded in some parts, and I'd
never read it. But at about chapter 2, I started to realize that I actually
have read it, maybe thirty years ago. Not only that, but I'm pretty sure I
actually have a copy somewhere on the shelves here at home. I'm going senile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well, at least it's the sort of senile that gives me quick, pleasant things
to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also this month: &lt;em&gt;The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet&lt;/em&gt; by Becky Chambers.
Once again, I wanted to like this so much. I started reading it twice, spaced
about 18 months apart. But each time, I just couldn't get into it, and
abandoned it about 1/3 in. It is indubitably me, not you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Genevieve Gornichec, 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old Norse mythology only briefly mentions the witch
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angrbo%C3%B0a"&gt;AngrboÃ°a&lt;/a&gt;,
as the mother of three "monsters", fathered by the trickster god, Loki. This
book explores her life, explicitly acknowledging her erasure as a woman, and
resolves it, providing her a powerful story, in which she survives men, gods,
and all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another fantastic Suze recommendation. Loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also this month: &lt;em&gt;The Emperess of Salt and Fortune&lt;/em&gt; by Nghi Vo. I wanted to
like this sooo much, and can see so many things about that are wonderful, but
for some reason I just couldn't get in the mood. The problem is indubitably me,
not you.&lt;/p&gt;
