<p><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/06/is-it-worthy.html">Everyone</a>
today is <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001134.html">abuzz</a>
with the 'release early, release often' sentiment, so I've decided to
get in the spirit and upload the first iteration of 'Sole Scion', my
summertime sabbatical game project.</p>
<p>Version 0.1 merely bounces some circles off an inclined plane
(pictured.) I aim to transform this into a 2D graphical adventure game,
in which I hope emergent fun will take place, once I populate the world
with enough twisty corridors, uniquely-shaped objects that need slotting
into the right places, and judicious instances of ornery fauna to
contend with.</p>
<p>It's written in Python, using
<a href="http://wiki.slembcke.net/main/published/Chipmunk">Chipmunk</a> for rigid
body Newtonian dynamics, with Python bindings using
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/pymunk/">Pymunk</a>. Rendering, gameloop, sounds,
etc are handled by <a href="http://pyglet.org">pyglet</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/sole-scion">Sole Scion is hosted on Google
Code</a>, with Subversion read-access
and a source code tarball, including the redistributables for the above
dependencies, should anyone be curious. It has a <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">New BSD
License</a>.</p>
<p>Feedback, thoughts and ideas, very welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I've only run it on Linux, but reportedly it also works on
Windows. Thanks Xtian!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> It also reportedly works under PyPy, provided you install
the 'functools' module. Thanks Maciej!</p>

<p><em>Carl G. Jung (Author), Joseph Campbell (Editor), R. F. C. Hull (Translator) (written 1920s &amp; '30s, published 1971)</em></p>
<p>I didn't quite know what to make of Jung when KT first handed me this
collection of his essays, many moons ago. Some sort of 19th-century
lunatic Freudian psycho-analyst who was a dab hand with a ouija board
and sang the praises of ritual sacrifices to the almighty triple-headed
hermaphrodite goddesses, right? Something like that.</p>
<p>So it was good to discover that Dr. Jung isn't the wild-eyed loon that
I'd written him off as. His attitude is entirely credible and
scientific, and while he may <em>invoke</em> triple-headed hermaphrodite
goddesses, he does so in an entirely respectable and deeply pertinent
way.</p>
<p>His essays are prefaced by a short biography to set the works in a
meaningful social and personal context. Of particular entertainment
value is the ongoing deterioration of his relationship with Freud, and
the corresponding divergence of their theories. This culminated in
Freud's desperate plea for Jung's cooperation in ensuring that 'the
sexual theory' be established as an unchallengeable axiom in the
explanation of all human behaviours. This didn't strike Jung as being
particularly scientific, and obviously speaks volumes about Freud -
lifelong adulterer - as both a person and a theorist.</p>
<p>Of the essays themselves, some of them resonated more for me than
others. I very much liked his explanation of the nature of the
subconscious necessarily being the polar opposite to the conscious ego,
since all perceptions which do not fit in with the beliefs or attitudes
of the conscious mind are dismissed and repressed. This is a natural and
normal reaction, and it helps us to maintain a consistent and useful
world-view. However, those repressed memories are not erased - they are
simply being ignored by the concious mind. The subconscious appears to
have unfettered access to these repressed fragments. In situations where
the conciousness exercises wilful determination, this leads to a
stressful state of cognitive dissonance, in which the subconscious
comprises a roiling mass of all the impressions and emotions that the
concious mind has rejected. Hence, the tendancy for people to maintain a
strident outward appearance which is completely at odds with, and
arguably exacerbates, pent-up inner demons. For some reason, the
examples that spring to my mind are priests molesting altar boys, or
maybe catholic schoolgirls. Not sure if that's a reflection of modern
organised religion or my own state of mind, oh well.</p>
<p>Equally interesting is Jung's theory of the collective unconscious -
that the religions, myths and legends of the world are united by a
handful of common themes, or archetypes, not because of
cross-pollination of ideas, but because these themes are an expression
of psychological commonalities between all human minds - seems credible
and useful. I still have some reservation in accepting Jung's particular
menagerie of archetypes as definitive. He may have distilled them from
many years studying the world's religions and mythologies, but if you
throw enough noise at a filter the result ends up being characteristic
of the filter (ie. Jung himself) rather than the noise. However, the
validity of the idea in general, and of some of fundamental archetypes,
seems unarguable.</p>
<p>He carefully avoids any explicit judgement of whether any religions or
myths have any basis in objective reality. Such judgements, he rightly
notes, are beyond the ability of the scientific method to evaluate.
However, he provides the potential to categorise them all as simply
being phenomena of human psychology - ie. they are entirely in our head.
This is a double-edge sword, however, for this seeming dismissal
rebounds poetically upon us. What were once distant and faintly heard
mythologies, are now given a deep and highly personal significance, as
they are nothing less than the worldy manifestations of the innermost
workings of our own minds, which each of us would fail to heed at our
peril.</p>
<p>There are other sections which I didn't find so compelling, such as his
concept of synchronicity, but overall it was thoroughly enjoyable and
insightful.</p>

<p>I *should* be searching out and evaluating Python geometry libraries.
But I keep getting these niggling impulses to start hammering out my own
vector, polygon and quaternion classes. Possibly in C. Ohdear.</p>
<p>Why is it so much easier, or at least so much more appealing, to start
beavering away on your own code, rather than to take the sensible
approach of evaluating existing libraries? A couple of hours searching
could save you days, weeks or months of work, and libraries written and
used by several people will undoubtedly be of higher quality as well -
it should be a no-brainer.</p>
<p>It's easy enough to conjure up subjective justifications for it on a
personal level, but to my mind they rarely hold up to scrutiny. Reading
and understanding other people's code is said to be harder than churning
out some according to your own vision, but surely the depth of
understanding required to use a module should surely be substantially
less than it would take to write it? Likewise, curiosity, obsessiveness,
a sense of personal achievement play a part, but these motives are
deeply subjective, and cannot be used to argue the case that 'rolling
your own' is an efficient or rational decision, merely an enjoyable (or
compulsive) one. Expectations of quality also contribute - everyone
thinks that their own code is better. But this is rarely really the
case, and experienced practitioners recognise it.</p>
<p>On a deeper level, then, why does some part of us allow these inadequate
justifications to hold sway? Even if rationally, we know it doesn't make
sense, why does it feel so <em>desirable</em>? What I'm really asking is, why
have we been evolved to want to build our own, even though it is so
clearly the wrong thing to do?</p>
<p>What if we are tuned, as individuals, to prematurely settle on our own
idiosyncratic approach? The net result would be that, for any given
problem, a flurry of individuals would each set out in different
directions, regardless of what results others might have already
achieved. Viewed as a group activity, this starts to sound a little
saner. Such a dispersion of individuals would rapidly and thoroughly
explore all the corners of the problem space. Compared to the situation
where we all just build cumulatively on what everyone else has done
before, the chances of any one individual finding an optimal answer is
low, but the chances of someone in the group finding it is greatly
increased.</p>
<p>It's a survival-of-the-group trait, that each of us is evolved to pick a
wrong-looking answer, and then expend ourselves beavering away to prove
it. Oh dear indeed.</p>

    <p>If you're not a wild-eyed loon, you're unlikely to appreciate this post.
Bear with me a moment, while I establish some context.</p>
<p><img alt="Cory Doctorow" src="files/2007/07/cory-doctorow.jpg"></p>
<p>So <a href="http://www.craphound.com/">here's the esteemed Cory Doctorow</a>. His
recent[*1] post at Locus, <a href="http://www.locusmag.com/Features/2007/07/cory-doctorow-progressive-apocalypse.html">The Progressive Apocalypse and Other
Futurismic
Delights</a>,
outlines the parallels between the progressive Enlightenment ideals of
human progress, and the science fiction hot topic of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_singularity">the
singularity</a>. Accelerating
rates of change, empowered by self-improving general artificial (or
post-human) intelligence, eventually reaches a point at which society -
or the individual - can do anything it wants to. Since, by that point,
society is so educated and well-adjusted, so <em>enlightened</em>, its goals
are those things that bring yet more progress and joy and compassion
into the world.</p>
<p>Describing this as a 'Rapture of the Nerds' (<a href="http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/steven/?p=21#comment-181">not by Ken
MacLeod</a>) is
evocative - but it distracts from the important fact that the <em>true</em>
singularity is a rapture for everyone. The singularity is only for nerds
right now because the nerds are the only ones who get it yet. I posit
that one of the most prominent effects of enlightenment - coupled with
the availability of resources that such enlightenment would allow - is
the freedom to indulge in fairly advanced morality, encompassing an
overwhelming realisation of the importance that no concious being gets
left behind. Incidentally, this is of course the reason why advanced
civilisations tend to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sublimed">sublime</a> <em>en masse</em>, without
leaving detectable offshoots mooching around in our universe.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I'm distracting myself. The important thread I'm groping for
here is the literal equivalence Cory alludes to between the science
fictional singularity, and the biblical judgement day - the trump and
the shout, the culmination of all things human, at which point it
becomes our turn to sublime, overcoming the restrictions of the physical
universe, to take our place in the mind of God Almighty, the living and
the dead alike. Or at least those of the dead who had sufficient
foresight to have had their state vector preserved, at any rate.</p>
<p>Still with me? Singularity = Judgement Day. Got it? Ok.</p>
<p><a href="http://sentientdevelopments.blogspot.com"><img alt="George
Dvorsky" src="files/2007/07/georgedvorsky.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Then, over here, we have
<a href="http://sentientdevelopments.blogspot.com">George Dvorsky</a>,
who recently[*1] referenced an old post of his, <a href="http://sentientdevelopments.blogspot.com/2006/03/our-non-arbitrary-universe.html">Our non-arbitrary
universe</a>,
in which he talks about possible explanations for the extraordinarily
unlikely state we find the universe to be in, while attempting to steer
clear of the slippery fish that is the strong anthropic principle.</p>
<p>One prominent hypothesis is that the universe's operational parameters
have been tuned with excruciating finesse by a process of natural
selection, which could be brought about by universes being
self-replicating entities. The replication of universes could therefore
be theorised, by some mechanism that is completely unknown. This would
lead us to expect that universes be tuned for maximal rate of
reproduction, whatever that would entail. So why, George asks, does our
universe appear to be tuned to be so patently <em>biophilic</em>, ie. conducive
to life? All these innumerable cosy blobs of matter basking in the glow
of lovely stars, all consisting of an entertaining mixture of quite the
most engaging set of chemicals one could ever wish to meet, and so on
and so forth, down to the infinitesimal balancing acts of forces that
conspire to make nuclear physics work in such a jolly interesting way,
and enough spatial dimensions to make interactions interesting without
so many as to subject them all to the tiresome severity of a whole
family of inverse to-the-ninth laws.</p>
<p>It might simply be that efficiently-replicating universes are
coincidentally also biophilic. Certainly there are some characteristics
that seem to be equally desirable for either condition, such as
universes that are both large and long-lived. However, George discusses
the idea of this not merely being a coincidental convergence, but
causal, due to life playing a role in helping universes to replicate -
hence universes teeming with life will go on to reproduce more,
dominating the natural selective process to create more universes which
are ever more suitable to life. This could come about if life plays some
part in the reproduction of its host universe. Perhaps if intelligent
life deliberately causes its host universe to replicate. Who wouldn't
want to become God, once we'd figured out how to spawn realities at
right-angles to... er... reality?</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>Now, I'd like to take a moment here to catch our breath. I'm well aware
that we're out on a limb of speculation that is extended so far beyond
the realms of anything resembling genuine hypothesis that we cannot
consider this to be anything other than a poetic fantasy.</p>
<p>And yet. I can't help but play with the idea of linking the two concepts
in my mind. Imagining post-singular civilisations discovering a
mechanism by which disjoint bubbles of time and space can be pinched off
from our own. Perhaps it can be done under some conditions that already
occur naturally, deep in the heart of stars, or in the wrenching
oscillations of time and space that wreath a galactic-mass black hole.
Or perhaps this is brought about by some conjunction of circumstance
that has never occurred before, at least not for all of <em>this</em>
universe's timeline.</p>
<p>The first such bubbles are stillborn. Empty and degenerate, lacking
coherence enough for either spatial or temporal dimensions, they
collapse in spans of time that can barely be considered to exist at all.
But the unimaginable intellect of planetary sized masses converted
entirely into hyper-spatially networked hive-minds examines the
new-found discovery, with an absolute, unerring insight, but also with
wisdom, and with compassion. Options are considered, consequences
charted, and at the speed of thought vast resources of matter and energy
are focussed on replicating the experiment. Enlarging it. Seeding the
discontinuities with precisely the right twist of quantum instability
for each of the nascent realities to spew forth their own internal
fountains of time and space, matter and energy. Riding the feedback of
previously uncharted mathematics to inflate each successive genesis to
greater and greater energies, weaving ever more intricate internal
structures into the harmonious interplay of forces that comprise their
innermost workings.</p>
<p>A pause. Awed by their achievements, overcome by the assimilation of the
fields of science they have uncovered, and humbled by their potential,
the intelligences stop to take stock. To survey their possibilities.
Then, inevitably, fulfilling a manifest destiny as old as time itself,
leveraging the qualities of the space gifted to them by their own,
infinitely distant forebears, they initialise a final push, building on
the properties of their own universe to create one still greater. A
leviathan, containing an unthinkable torrent of creation, bright enough
to light a sky with its echoes forever.</p>
<p>It's the whole "Let there be light" number. Humanity gets to literally
<em>become</em> God. And the funny thing is, such a creator is not only imbued
with all the properties of a traditional new-testament Christian style
God, ie. wisdom and compassion and love, but we simultaneously tie
together the Judgement Day of one civilisation's culmination with the
Genesis of another's reality. Each successive generation irrevocably
separated from their own God by being at right angles to their reality,
and yet tied in chains stretching back unbroken through the countless
histories of innumerable universes, by the bonds of direct, causal
creation.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it's all very derivative, and I stole one irresistible phrase
from <a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/2006/20060904/house-f.shtml">Benjamin
Rosenbaum</a>,
but it would make for a smashing short science fiction story, don't you

<p>There is, of course,
no point whatsoever in me posting a belated review of the Simpsons
Movie, which I and everyone else gleefully watched many months ago now.
To the now long abandoned discussions of its merit I have absolutely
nothing of value to contribute.</p>
<p>However, that shall not dissuade me from posting this one anyway, since
such posts as these are not, as you might assume, for the benefit of my
readership, few and benighted as they might be, but instead form an
attempt to chart my media consumption habits for my own retrospective
perusal.</p>
<p>It was with some dismay, therefore, that I noted that this inverted
system of priorities is mirrored in the Herculean task of my reading of
other people's posts. Simply put, I seem to be reading other people's
blogs in order to make them feel good, upping their stats, making
complimentary comments, showing an interest, etc, etc, rather than for
my own benefit. Once this cold fact had impinged upon my conciousness, I
had only one course of action left open: Cold Turkey. That's right. No
more Google Reader.</p>
<p>Abandoning the hampster wheel should free up a considerable amount of my
time for other activities, and I am keen to quantify that process, so I
will be keeping detailed logs of my time usage for a few days prior and
post the switchover, to ascertain exactly how many hours I previously
spent looking at labelled pictures of cats, which I will henceforth
presumably be free to spend looking at <em>actual</em> labels on cats (or
possibly labels on <em>actual</em> pictures of cats, let's not get overly
ambitious.)</p>
<p>In a final layer of delicious irony, I shall of course be blogging
comprehensively about the entire experience, however your collective
reactions to that will remain forever unknown to me. Henceforth you
should consider me to be a purely one-way conduit of information.
Goodbye forever.</p>

<p><em>by Douglas Coupland</em></p>
<p>jPod is a flamboyant return to the corporate cube-farms of <em>Microserfs</em>,
arguably the site of Coupland's greatest previous victories. Characters
reveal their desperation in guilty subversive rebellions against the
corporate tyranny that their apathy condemns them to be ruled by. The
artificial intimacy of long-term adjacent cubespace leads to the gleeful
exposure of each other's sexual foibles, drug habits, and all the
diverse pariphenalia with which they parade their various neuroses.</p>
<p>It's an enjoyably postmodern romp, complete with art-school
typographical experiments, the recurring appearance of the author as a
minor character, and most of all, the infusion of the whimsical
philosophies of the GenX protagonists. Even so, I can't escape the
feeling that it's a retread, rather than a successor. When he wrote
<em>Microserfs</em>, the newfound viewpoints of the digitally-savvy were fresh
and exciting, and Coupland triumphantly provided the voice they lacked.
Nowadays such views can stand on their own, indeed they are beginning to
comprise mainstream society, and observational exposition such as
Coupland's has become redundant. When a character notes with surprise
that the Kodak company still exists, and wonders how many years it has
been since they employed any young people, it might have been a wry and
insightful comment ten years ago. Now it's merely tired and lagging, by
virtue of harping on about a worldview that the target audience has all
taken as read for as long as we can remember.</p>
<p>Rating: 6/10 - A mixed bag.</p>

<p>At
the end of March, Susan and I exchanged rings, vows, signatures and
thumbprints on a beach near to Tulum, Mexico, with eighty-five of our
families and friends, plus 'TriPawd', the beach's resident three-legged
dog.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone for coming all the way to join the party and making
it so special. It all worked out better than we could have hoped - We
never imagined that our own wedding would be so spectacularly brilliant.
The honeymoon in Guatemala was also astonishingly good, from watching
the sun rise over Mayan ruins in the jungle, to hiking volcanoes
overlooking lake Atitlan.</p>
<p>We've taken photos from a few people, and put a selection of the best of
these online, listed below:</p>

<p><a href="https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipM04-dGG9h_wCxE57Ut2zg9k7VsxEf-O2hAzWvr">Some blurry photos are up</a>
of an
absolutely brilliant stag event in Denver, starting with an afternoon of
UK vs rest-of-the-world tomfoolery, which included the most laughing
I've done in ages. After a brilliant curry and singstar-style action at
Pete's ultimate downtown loft, I was presented with my outfit for the
evening (pictured.) We made a beeline for The Bank to reprise the
stalwart Colfax crawl route, where we were intercepted by <em>the ladies</em>,
and where we then, in turn, intercepted Dana Sisti's engagement party.
Finished the night roasting gently in Phil's hot-tub until the dawn.
Brilliant.</p>
<p>So brilliant to see everyone. Luv ya! Mean it!</p>
<p>Some much better photos by people with steadier hands and real cameras:</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Oh god, there's a <a href="http://www.aaronsdayoff.com/2008/03/jbs-bachelor-partypub-crawl.html">video of the
cowbell</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The scores are in. It was difficult to discern in the heat
of battle, but a rigourous statistical analysis reveals that team UK
absolutely dominated the laser quest:</p>
