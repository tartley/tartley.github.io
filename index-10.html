<p>If you're not a wild-eyed loon, you're unlikely to appreciate this post.
Bear with me a moment, while I establish some context.</p>
<p><img alt="Cory Doctorow" src="files/2007/07/cory-doctorow.jpg"></p>
<p>So <a href="http://www.craphound.com/">here's the esteemed Cory Doctorow</a>. His
recent[*1] post at Locus, <a href="http://www.locusmag.com/Features/2007/07/cory-doctorow-progressive-apocalypse.html">The Progressive Apocalypse and Other
Futurismic
Delights</a>,
outlines the parallels between the progressive Enlightenment ideals of
human progress, and the science fiction hot topic of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_singularity">the
singularity</a>. Accelerating
rates of change, empowered by self-improving general artificial (or
post-human) intelligence, eventually reaches a point at which society -
or the individual - can do anything it wants to. Since, by that point,
society is so educated and well-adjusted, so <em>enlightened</em>, its goals
are those things that bring yet more progress and joy and compassion
into the world.</p>
<p>Describing this as a 'Rapture of the Nerds' (<a href="http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/steven/?p=21#comment-181">not by Ken
MacLeod</a>) is
evocative - but it distracts from the important fact that the <em>true</em>
singularity is a rapture for everyone. The singularity is only for nerds
right now because the nerds are the only ones who get it yet. I posit
that one of the most prominent effects of enlightenment - coupled with
the availability of resources that such enlightenment would allow - is
the freedom to indulge in fairly advanced morality, encompassing an
overwhelming realisation of the importance that no concious being gets
left behind. Incidentally, this is of course the reason why advanced
civilisations tend to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sublimed">sublime</a> <em>en masse</em>, without
leaving detectable offshoots mooching around in our universe.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I'm distracting myself. The important thread I'm groping for
here is the literal equivalence Cory alludes to between the science
fictional singularity, and the biblical judgement day - the trump and
the shout, the culmination of all things human, at which point it
becomes our turn to sublime, overcoming the restrictions of the physical
universe, to take our place in the mind of God Almighty, the living and
the dead alike. Or at least those of the dead who had sufficient
foresight to have had their state vector preserved, at any rate.</p>
<p>Still with me? Singularity = Judgement Day. Got it? Ok.</p>
<p><a href="http://sentientdevelopments.blogspot.com"><img alt="George
Dvorsky" src="files/2007/07/georgedvorsky.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Then, over here, we have
<a href="http://sentientdevelopments.blogspot.com">George Dvorsky</a>,
who recently[*1] referenced an old post of his, <a href="http://sentientdevelopments.blogspot.com/2006/03/our-non-arbitrary-universe.html">Our non-arbitrary
universe</a>,
in which he talks about possible explanations for the extraordinarily
unlikely state we find the universe to be in, while attempting to steer
clear of the slippery fish that is the strong anthropic principle.</p>
<p>One prominent hypothesis is that the universe's operational parameters
have been tuned with excruciating finesse by a process of natural
selection, which could be brought about by universes being
self-replicating entities. The replication of universes could therefore
be theorised, by some mechanism that is completely unknown. This would
lead us to expect that universes be tuned for maximal rate of
reproduction, whatever that would entail. So why, George asks, does our
universe appear to be tuned to be so patently <em>biophilic</em>, ie. conducive
to life? All these innumerable cosy blobs of matter basking in the glow
of lovely stars, all consisting of an entertaining mixture of quite the
most engaging set of chemicals one could ever wish to meet, and so on
and so forth, down to the infinitesimal balancing acts of forces that
conspire to make nuclear physics work in such a jolly interesting way,
and enough spatial dimensions to make interactions interesting without
so many as to subject them all to the tiresome severity of a whole
family of inverse to-the-ninth laws.</p>
<p>It might simply be that efficiently-replicating universes are
coincidentally also biophilic. Certainly there are some characteristics
that seem to be equally desirable for either condition, such as
universes that are both large and long-lived. However, George discusses
the idea of this not merely being a coincidental convergence, but
causal, due to life playing a role in helping universes to replicate -
hence universes teeming with life will go on to reproduce more,
dominating the natural selective process to create more universes which
are ever more suitable to life. This could come about if life plays some
part in the reproduction of its host universe. Perhaps if intelligent
life deliberately causes its host universe to replicate. Who wouldn't
want to become God, once we'd figured out how to spawn realities at
right-angles to... er... reality?</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>Now, I'd like to take a moment here to catch our breath. I'm well aware
that we're out on a limb of speculation that is extended so far beyond
the realms of anything resembling genuine hypothesis that we cannot
consider this to be anything other than a poetic fantasy.</p>
<p>And yet. I can't help but play with the idea of linking the two concepts
in my mind. Imagining post-singular civilisations discovering a
mechanism by which disjoint bubbles of time and space can be pinched off
from our own. Perhaps it can be done under some conditions that already
occur naturally, deep in the heart of stars, or in the wrenching
oscillations of time and space that wreath a galactic-mass black hole.
Or perhaps this is brought about by some conjunction of circumstance
that has never occurred before, at least not for all of <em>this</em>
universe's timeline.</p>
<p>The first such bubbles are stillborn. Empty and degenerate, lacking
coherence enough for either spatial or temporal dimensions, they
collapse in spans of time that can barely be considered to exist at all.
But the unimaginable intellect of planetary sized masses converted
entirely into hyper-spatially networked hive-minds examines the
new-found discovery, with an absolute, unerring insight, but also with
wisdom, and with compassion. Options are considered, consequences
charted, and at the speed of thought vast resources of matter and energy
are focussed on replicating the experiment. Enlarging it. Seeding the
discontinuities with precisely the right twist of quantum instability
for each of the nascent realities to spew forth their own internal
fountains of time and space, matter and energy. Riding the feedback of
previously uncharted mathematics to inflate each successive genesis to
greater and greater energies, weaving ever more intricate internal
structures into the harmonious interplay of forces that comprise their
innermost workings.</p>
<p>A pause. Awed by their achievements, overcome by the assimilation of the
fields of science they have uncovered, and humbled by their potential,
the intelligences stop to take stock. To survey their possibilities.
Then, inevitably, fulfilling a manifest destiny as old as time itself,
leveraging the qualities of the space gifted to them by their own,
infinitely distant forebears, they initialise a final push, building on
the properties of their own universe to create one still greater. A
leviathan, containing an unthinkable torrent of creation, bright enough
to light a sky with its echoes forever.</p>
<p>It's the whole "Let there be light" number. Humanity gets to literally
<em>become</em> God. And the funny thing is, such a creator is not only imbued
with all the properties of a traditional new-testament Christian style
God, ie. wisdom and compassion and love, but we simultaneously tie
together the Judgement Day of one civilisation's culmination with the
Genesis of another's reality. Each successive generation irrevocably
separated from their own God by being at right angles to their reality,
and yet tied in chains stretching back unbroken through the countless
histories of innumerable universes, by the bonds of direct, causal
creation.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it's all very derivative, and I stole one irresistible phrase
from <a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/2006/20060904/house-f.shtml">Benjamin
Rosenbaum</a>,
but it would make for a smashing short science fiction story, don't you
think?</p>
<p>(Note *1: I wrote most of this months ago, but never got around to
hitting 'Post', so forgive the no-longer accurate references to 'recent'
events.)</p>

<p>There is, of course,
no point whatsoever in me posting a belated review of the Simpsons
Movie, which I and everyone else gleefully watched many months ago now.
To the now long abandoned discussions of its merit I have absolutely
nothing of value to contribute.</p>
<p>However, that shall not dissuade me from posting this one anyway, since
such posts as these are not, as you might assume, for the benefit of my
readership, few and benighted as they might be, but instead form an
attempt to chart my media consumption habits for my own retrospective
perusal.</p>
<p>It was with some dismay, therefore, that I noted that this inverted
system of priorities is mirrored in the Herculean task of my reading of
other people's posts. Simply put, I seem to be reading other people's
blogs in order to make them feel good, upping their stats, making
complimentary comments, showing an interest, etc, etc, rather than for
my own benefit. Once this cold fact had impinged upon my conciousness, I
had only one course of action left open: Cold Turkey. That's right. No
more Google Reader.</p>
<p>Abandoning the hampster wheel should free up a considerable amount of my
time for other activities, and I am keen to quantify that process, so I
will be keeping detailed logs of my time usage for a few days prior and
post the switchover, to ascertain exactly how many hours I previously
spent looking at labelled pictures of cats, which I will henceforth
presumably be free to spend looking at <em>actual</em> labels on cats (or
possibly labels on <em>actual</em> pictures of cats, let's not get overly
ambitious.)</p>
<p>In a final layer of delicious irony, I shall of course be blogging
comprehensively about the entire experience, however your collective
reactions to that will remain forever unknown to me. Henceforth you
should consider me to be a purely one-way conduit of information.
Goodbye forever.</p>

<p><em>by Douglas Coupland</em></p>
<p>jPod is a flamboyant return to the corporate cube-farms of <em>Microserfs</em>,
arguably the site of Coupland's greatest previous victories. Characters
reveal their desperation in guilty subversive rebellions against the
corporate tyranny that their apathy condemns them to be ruled by. The
artificial intimacy of long-term adjacent cubespace leads to the gleeful
exposure of each other's sexual foibles, drug habits, and all the
diverse pariphenalia with which they parade their various neuroses.</p>
<p>It's an enjoyably postmodern romp, complete with art-school
typographical experiments, the recurring appearance of the author as a
minor character, and most of all, the infusion of the whimsical
philosophies of the GenX protagonists. Even so, I can't escape the
feeling that it's a retread, rather than a successor. When he wrote
<em>Microserfs</em>, the newfound viewpoints of the digitally-savvy were fresh
and exciting, and Coupland triumphantly provided the voice they lacked.
Nowadays such views can stand on their own, indeed they are beginning to
comprise mainstream society, and observational exposition such as
Coupland's has become redundant. When a character notes with surprise
that the Kodak company still exists, and wonders how many years it has
been since they employed any young people, it might have been a wry and
insightful comment ten years ago. Now it's merely tired and lagging, by
virtue of harping on about a worldview that the target audience has all
taken as read for as long as we can remember.</p>

<p>At
the end of March, Susan and I exchanged rings, vows, signatures and
thumbprints on a beach near to Tulum, Mexico, with eighty-five of our
families and friends, plus 'TriPawd', the beach's resident three-legged
dog.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone for coming all the way to join the party and making
it so special. It all worked out better than we could have hoped - We
never imagined that our own wedding would be so spectacularly brilliant.
The honeymoon in Guatemala was also astonishingly good, from watching
the sun rise over Mayan ruins in the jungle, to hiking volcanoes
overlooking lake Atitlan.</p>

these online, listed below:</p>

<p><a href="https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipM04-dGG9h_wCxE57Ut2zg9k7VsxEf-O2hAzWvr">Some blurry photos are up</a>
of an
absolutely brilliant stag event in Denver, starting with an afternoon of
UK vs rest-of-the-world tomfoolery, which included the most laughing
I've done in ages. After a brilliant curry and singstar-style action at
Pete's ultimate downtown loft, I was presented with my outfit for the
evening (pictured.) We made a beeline for The Bank to reprise the
stalwart Colfax crawl route, where we were intercepted by <em>the ladies</em>,
and where we then, in turn, intercepted Dana Sisti's engagement party.
Finished the night roasting gently in Phil's hot-tub until the dawn.
Brilliant.</p>
<p>So brilliant to see everyone. Luv ya! Mean it!</p>
<p>Some much better photos by people with steadier hands and real cameras:</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Oh god, there's a <a href="http://www.aaronsdayoff.com/2008/03/jbs-bachelor-partypub-crawl.html">video of the
cowbell</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The scores are in. It was difficult to discern in the heat
of battle, but a rigourous statistical analysis reveals that team UK
absolutely dominated the laser quest:</p>

<p>Peter Batty has a funky screencast of his incipient social networking

future itinerary crosses paths with other people you know. Initially
implemented as a <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/whereyougonnabe/">Facebook

Earth integration. It's currently restricted to beta testers, but should
be opening up to all comers soon.</p>
<p>One day, functionality like this will be part of the ubiquitous and
unobtrusive infrastructure of society. For now, there's WYGB.</p>

<p>It got a right drubbing critically, and was a box-office failure, but I
found it powerful and compelling. It may not be crafted with the
greatest finesse, but nevertheless it raises interesting and powerful
questions, of the competence of our leaders in war, of the culpability
of the media in towing the line, and of the personal responsibility that
falls to each of us.</p>
<p>Most Americans seem unaware that their <a href="http://www.moblogic.tv/video/2008/03/10/whos-got-the-guns-2/">profligate spending on
'defence'</a>,
coupled with regular invasions of other countries, cause them to be
regarded by much of the rest of the world as the single biggest threat
to world peace.</p>
<p>In such an environment, this movie asks us to have the bravery to let
our point of view be known, and to take action when our beliefs
contradict our Goverments' decision to go to war. For anyone with
questions about the justification for the recent wars that America has
started (and my own country England has supported) this movie raises
many issues, and spoke powerfully to my conscience.</p>
<p>Rating 8/10.</p>

<p>PyCon 2008 has been absolutely amazing this week. The talks I've seen
and the people I've met have been a real inspiration, and my head is
a-whirl with ideas. Above all, as always, I'm impressed by the Python
community's genuine warmth. Maybe it's just a function of Python being
relatively small compared to some other technologies, but there's
something pleasantly hippy (in a good way) about its practitioners.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido</a>, for example,
unsurprisingly turns out to be eminently reasonable and affable, and the
<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython">IronPython</a>
team, to whom I and Resolver owe so much, are a thoroughly pleasant and
interesting bunch.</p>
<p>To the people who have been asking for my humble talk slides, you can
grab them here in a couple of formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>The slides as Open Office (tuned for Linux fonts, but more-or-less
    fine on Windows):
    <a href="files/2008/03/tddbrookssilverbullet.zip" title="TddBrooksSilverBullet.zip (103kb)">TddBrooksSilverBullet.zip</a>
    (103kb)</li>
<li>The slides as PDF (fonts 100% good for everyone, but I think the
    various animations are gone:)
    <a href="files/2008/03/tddbrookssilverbullet.pdf" title="TddBrooksSilverBullet.pdf (162kb)">TddBrooksSilverBullet.pdf</a>
    (162kb)</li>
<li>The accompanying source code:
    <a href="files/2008/03/tddbrookssilverbullet-src.zip" title="TddBrooksSilverBullet-src.zip (536kb)">TddBrooksSilverBullet-src.zip</a>
    (536kb)</li>
</ul>
<p>If anyone has any outstanding thoughts or questions about the talk, I
always love to chat, so please feel free to email me,
tartley at the domain tartley.com (gosh I love love love

obfuscated - spamarrest is no more.)</p>
