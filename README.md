# IDEAS

## Political

I am living in the foriegn land. Educate myself on political history.
Use that as an excuse to broadcast political thoughts to educate ingrates
on facebook. Examples:

* History of democracy. First democratic nations - how did they each qualify it?

* History of republicans vs democrats. Perhaps broken down, ie:

* Fiscal conservatism. Is it real?

* How were modern rights won? Introduced by republicans or democrats?
  Were there protests? Property damage? Riots?
  To what extent is it true that the left has won these valuable rights?
  * Weekends / 40 hour work week
  * Minimum wage
  * Abolition of slavery
  * right to collective bargaining & unions
  * safe workplaces
  * women's vote

## Middle Age

I'm not remotely as mentally agile as I used to be.
* Need more sleep. Or am I just more aware of how lack of sleep affects?
  - presumably both.
* Don't have the mental stamina. Or am I just more aware of how my performance
  degrades after sustained effort?
* My typing, which always contained slapdash typing errors, has now started to
  include odd word substitutions.
* I'm forgetful.
* I lack constancy of purpose. Can I enumerate the aspects of intelligence, and
  see which ones are most affected? Are they quantifiable? Improvable?

# TODO

Categories vs Tags
Categories: A post has one. They can be flat or a hierarchy.
Tags: A post can have many. No hierarchy.
Decide which to use (or both?)
Normalize their case.

* get my python feed reinstated on planetpython

Customize theme to:
    Put tags at top of posts instead of bottom?
    Put tags at top of posts in index

Get Disqus working

Check what has happened to old metadata.
Are we leaving anything behind that we care about, eg. old comments.

Import old comments? Or can we at least display them?

Skim through handbook for other nice features?
* Social buttons?
* Alt layout for that type of 'short form' post

Click around a few pages to see what else does not work.

* Embed ancient backed up tartley.com content, and link to it.
