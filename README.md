Uses Nikola. See Makefile for some handy commands.

## TODO

* favicon?

Customize theme to:
    Put tags at top of posts?
    Put tags at top of posts in index
    Check it still works with index teasers
    Turn on Index teasers?
        Using a 'description' for posts?
    Put an hr between index posts?
        Maybe they do already? HR in posts is invisible.
    About link in the header?
        Move license info there?

Categories vs Tags
Categories: A post has one. They can be flat or a hierarchy.
Tags: A post can have many. No hierarchy.
Decide which to use (or both?)
Normalize their case.

* get my python feed reinstated on planetpython

Get Disqus working

Check what has happened to old metadata.
Are we leaving anything behind that we care about, eg. old comments.

Import old comments? Or can we at least display them?

Skim through handbook for other nice features?
* Social buttons?

Click around a few pages to see what else does not work.
* package icon in .tar.gz download on:
