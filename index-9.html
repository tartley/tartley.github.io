<p>PyCon 2008 has been absolutely amazing this week. The talks I've seen
and the people I've met have been a real inspiration, and my head is
a-whirl with ideas. Above all, as always, I'm impressed by the Python
community's genuine warmth. Maybe it's just a function of Python being
relatively small compared to some other technologies, but there's
something pleasantly hippy (in a good way) about its practitioners.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido</a>, for example,
unsurprisingly turns out to be eminently reasonable and affable, and the
<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython">IronPython</a>
team, to whom I and Resolver owe so much, are a thoroughly pleasant and
interesting bunch.</p>
<p>To the people who have been asking for my humble talk slides, you can
grab them here in a couple of formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>The slides as Open Office (tuned for Linux fonts, but more-or-less
    fine on Windows):

    (103kb)</li>
<li>The slides as PDF (fonts 100% good for everyone, but I think the
    various animations are gone:)
    <a href="files/2008/03/tddbrookssilverbullet.pdf" title="TddBrooksSilverBullet.pdf (162kb)">TddBrooksSilverBullet.pdf</a>
    (162kb)</li>
<li>The accompanying source code:

    (536kb)</li>
</ul>
<p>If anyone has any outstanding thoughts or questions about the talk, I
always love to chat, so please feel free to email me,

<p>We've all known this for a long time, but I don't remember anyone
actually saying it out loud: Have you ever noticed how it's always the
most industrious LinkedIn users who are the very last people you'd
actually recommend in a genuine network of trust?</p>
<p>The most ruthless networkers, climbing every last tenuous connection
like an insidious vine. Grasping for unearned advantage at every node.
Can you introduce me to so-and-so? If you link to me, I'll have over 500
connections, think how popular that will make me look. My preciousss
connectivity. Somehow, this kind of behaviour also correlates well with
other repugnant activities, like spamming. Some people just have no
conception of how their actions change the world around them for better
or worse, and hence act as though they had no responsibilities to the
community around them.</p>
<p>One final spam this morning broke the camel's back. I've asked him not
to do it before, both personally, and via the captcha screen he
disingenuously filled in to get onto my whitelist. So it's time for
LinkedIn to start pulling its weight. I notice there is no mechanism to
add a <em>negative</em> recommendation via LinkedIn, so I've been forced to add
him as a connection and then leave a suitable-worded positive one.
Hopefully it still conveys my intended semantic.</p>
<p>It may be that publicly dissing a recruiter is not the wisest of career
moves, and maybe James will get retaliatory. I weighed that up for a
while, and decided I can risk that. I don't operate on appearance. I
operate on substance. I can take it. Some things are right, and some
things are wrong, and It's time to take a stand.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even this is a half-hearted measure - I think James needs
to approve it for it to be attached to his profile, and that seems
unlikely from my perspective. Who knows, though? Maybe he's actually a
stickler for accurate representation who relishes feedback.</p>
<p>So this got me thinking. Forget LinkedIn - it's clearly designed to
appeal to vacuous self-congratulators. What attributes would we want
from a *real* network of trust? Clearly some mechanism for leaving
public negative feedback would be one of them. Can that be done in a way
that can't be abused? What else does it need?</p>

<p>The festival is organised by a large group, including former Resolver
legends Jan and <a href="http://konryd.blogspot.com/">Konrad</a>, and covers a
diverse array of IT and related topics. It is the largest event of its
type in Central Europe. Some talks were in English, some in Polish, by
an absolutely stellar line-up of luminary speakers, including Joe
Armstrong, creator of Erland; Gilad Bracha, co-creator of Java; plus
yours truly. See 'one of these things is not like the others.'</p>

.floatleft}A friend who is a doctor is considering learning Python as
his first programming language, to do some processing on some research
data. He asked me to give him the 30 second elevator pitch for Python,
to evaluate whether it's a wise choice. I enjoyed constructing the reply
so much that I decided to post it here, just in case it helps anyone
else in a similar situation.</p>
<h3>Why Python?</h3>
<p>Python is very accessible and intuitive. You should be able to produce
simple, useful programs in your first day of experimentation. The syntax
is clean and concise, without too much cryptic punctuation
(<a href="http://tartley.com/?p=197">Perl</a>, I'm looking at you), redundancy or
unnecessary verbosity.</p>
<p>This accessibility isn't just a superficial convenience. Because of it,
writing a program in Python will take noticeably less time than many
other programming languages. The resulting program will be shorter and
more comprehensible, and will be easy to modify or extend in the future.</p>
<p>The simplicity of Python is not because it is in any way cut-down or
incapable. In fact, it is one of the most limber languages available,
including a carefully chosen cross-section of advanced language design
features, which enable it to adapt gracefully to many different
situations and programming styles. Its beauty lies in its ability to
provide the aforementioned simplicity regardless of the complexity of
the task to which you choose to put it.</p>
<p>Of those language design features, a couple are worthy of special
mention.</p>
<p>Python is one of a number of <em>dynamic languages</em>, which are in vogue at
the moment. Proponents would say that the entire history of programming
has been a gradual migration towards progressively more dynamic
languages. Dynamic languages, amongst other things, allow you to write
programs that modify themselves when they run. Instead of simply writing
a function yourself, you can instead write a function which <em>creates
a second function</em>, and then call this second function, which will do
the thing you want done. This, and other sorts of brain-bending
meta-programming, seem a little abstract at first, but sometimes allow
some tremendous conceptual ju-jitsu, allowing very small amounts of code
to achieve enormous things.</p>
<p>Secondly, Python's dynamism facilitates a programming style known as
test driven development, of which I am big fan. The idea is that for
every bit of code you write, you <em>also</em> write a test, which
verifies that your code is doing the right thing. It isn't immediately
obvious that this is necessarily a very useful thing to do, but in
practice it reaps tremendous benefits. I evangelise about it often,
because I feel it is the single most important thing that most
programmers could do in order to be more productive and write better
code.</p>
<p>As well as the language itself, Python comes bundled with a
comprehensive set of pragmatic built-in standard libraries, which your
program can lean on to help you get things done with a minimum of
hassle. These libraries are augmented by a vibrant community of authors
producing third-party modules you can download and use as well.</p>
<p>As any good language should be, Python is cross-platform, so with a
minimum of tweaking, most Python programs should run on Windows or Macs
or Linux.</p>
<h4>Why not Python?</h4>
<p>A notable alternative to Python is Ruby, which looks like a delightful
environment and community to be in. As a general-purpose tool, Ruby is
just as good as Python, and it excels in certain areas such as website
development. But Ruby is not compellingly better than Python. They are
more similar than they are different, and form healthy rivals.</p>
<p>There are other languages that are better than Python at particular
things, but none, in my opinion, are better than it for <em>most</em>
things.</p>
<p>Something like C++ is better for sheer speed of program execution, or
for addressing the low-level bits and bytes that make up the electronics
of your computer. But it takes <em>years</em> to master C++. It's a
hard-core programmers language. I spent seven years living and breathing
it, and feel qualified to say that its practitioners can be slightly
masochistic about its inaccessible superiority. Even once mastered, it
is still a lot of work to write C++ programs.</p>
<p>Java and C# are both very popular indeed - orders of magnitude more so
than Python, and are ubiquitous in conservative corporate enterprise
consulting shops. Both are slightly frowned-upon by computer science
academics (C#, for example, for being ostensibly tied to Windows), but
nevertheless, these languages are not bad choices for many people.</p>
<p>Programs written in Python are usually slower than any other mainstream
programming language. This could be an issue if you intend to
intensively crunch large amounts of data in CPU intensive ways, for
example running a finite element analysis.</p>
<p>There are many Python libraries you can call which are, under the
covers, written in C. A prominent example is NumPy, for doing numerical
processing. Libraries like this might circumvent the performance issue
if one of them happens to handle your particular problem.</p>
<p>Even if there is no appropriate library available, slow performance
isn't as serious a drawback as it sounds. 99% of programs don't need to
do these sort of CPU intensive tasks, so Python's slowness makes no
discernible difference. Even in cases where performance is a factor,
Python makes it easy to modify and optimise your code to make it run
faster, which often alleviates the problem entirely.</p>
<p>Python uses indentation to define blocks of code instead of 'begin/end'
or '{}' delimiters like other languages. This caused no small amount of
controversy when it was introduced, with many veteran programmers
recoiling in horror, imagining nightmare scenarios in which simply
changing the whitespace in a program (eg adding more spaces or tab
characters) would unexpectedly change a program's behaviour. In
practice, however, this does not ever cause problems, and actually
eliminates an entire class of errors, wherein a programs appear to
behave strangely because the programmer has failed to keep the
indentation (which is useful to human readers of the code) in sync with
the delimiters (which are used by the computer.)</p>
<p>Multi-threading is an advanced technique in which a program casts off
new versions of itself, all running around simultaneously helping each
other out, sorcerers apprentice style. Python does not handle this well,
only utilising a single CPU on dual or quad core machines, and often
requiring careful crafting of finicky constructs to get it working
reliably. However, this is equally awkward in almost every other
language, and has had programmers tearing their hair out for decades, no
matter what language they use. There are exciting new approaches to this
in the language Erlang, but this is still too fringe to recommend as a
first language.</p>
<p>Python lacks some of the delightful academic brilliance of hardcore
functional languages such as Lisp and its derivatives, which are based
on the mathematics of the lambda calculus. In the right hands, these
tools can be devastatingly elegant and highly productive. However, many
of them lack a degree of day-to-day practicality in terms of available
libraries, and most people feel that they are initially unintuitive to
learn. Such languages will no doubt remain highly influential in
computer science circles, and are having something of a renaissance
these days, but they are sufficiently unorthodox for me not to recommend
as someone's first (and possibly only) programming language.</p>

<p>Accessible, entertaining, rich with historical perspective, and cuts
incisively to the core of modern society's conflict over intellectual

    <p>This is just a refinement of <a href="pyglet-week-2-better-vertex-throughput">last week's
script</a>. No massively significant changes,
just a bunch of minor tweaks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The fans are replaced with slightly prettier flowers, with separate
    vertex and color arrays for each one.</li>
<li>Running with the python -O flag means we can render 800 flowers at
    30fps, no problem.</li>
<li>The camera can now be moved and rotated and zoomed. I just use this
    to subtly zoom in after the screen has filled with flowers</li>
<li>I discovered that if I fail to clear the screen before rendering,
    then I inherit the appearance of the desktop as a backdrop. No doubt
    this cannot be relied upon, and presumably doesn't happen on some
    other graphics hardware or operating systems, so YMMV (<strong>Update:</strong>
    yep - it looks CRAZY on Windows unless you uncomment the glClear()
    call). I won't be relying on this trick in future, but for now, on
    my machine at least, it looks like this:</li>

<p><a href="http://www.susannahertrich.com/html/humansanimals.html">Susanna
Hertrich</a> has an
art / thesis project to artificially stimulate people's threat
perceptions (by giving them goosebumps, or making hairs stand on end) in
response to <em>actual</em> threats, as opposed to perceived ones. It's a topic
that I'm unnaturally preoccupied with, since the most egregious examples
of the disparity between the two seem to intrude on my life every day.
My opinions about whether any given threat is real or illusiory seem to
differ from almost everyone, but I'm going to stubbornly cling to the
idea that everyone else is crazy. Take the entry on 'terrorist attack'
as an example (see diagram.) Public reactions to the topic remind me of
nothing so much as a stirred-up ants nest, a psychotic, ineffectual
frenzy.</p>

<p><em>33 essays, edited by Andy Oram</em></p>
<p>I was wondering how to explain why I didn't like this book as much as I
thought I would - possibly as much as I thought I <em>ought</em> to. Thirty-odd
genius bitwranglers delving into their favourite bits of code - surely
it must be <em>packed</em> with fabulous insights into the zen of programming.
But something about it left me flat, and I was having trouble putting my
finger on why. Fortunately Jeff Atwood's ever brilliant <em>Coding Horror</em>
has saved me the bother, by <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001062.html">explaining it
perfectly</a>.</p>
<p>Programmers love code. It is the culmination of their labours. It's not
just a document or a diagram, but is a dynamic, living record of their
conceptual jujutso. But to focus on the code itself, in a variety of
languages, which few readers are likely to be familiar with all of, is a
relatively superficial theme, and comes at the expense of the abstract
designs that the code embodies, and of the features and capabilities of
the languages themselves.</p>
<p>Rating 6/10: Contains some gems, but generally falls between two stools.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.viagen.com/en/our-services/preserving-your-pets/">These

store samples of your pet's DNA, so that in the event of their death,
you can replace them with a newer, younger clone.</p>

<p>Apart from the fact it's a gimmick ripoff (\$1,500 to store my pets DNA?
That's quite a freezer they must have there, and the hypothetical
cloning service 'may be offered by some other company at a future time')
it seems to totally miss the point.</p>
<p>If you love your pet, it's surely for their personality. Your shared
experiences and memories, having grown to know one another. I'm talking
about their <em>soul</em>, or the state vector of their consciousness, whatever
you want to call it. Growing a clone in their image is like creating a
twin - it bears no relation to the animal you loved but for its
superficial appearance, and even seems to me to be an insult to the
memory of your former pet, that they could be replaced by the next one
off the shelf. Certainly I wouldn't like to think my loved ones would be
content to replace <em>me</em> with a look-alike.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder why we make it so hard on ourselves trying to make an
honest buck when the rest of the world is one big scam, preying on the
vulnerable and the unwary.</p>
