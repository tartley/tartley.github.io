A lot of people really like this, but it really isn't for me. The plot
is an eerie recreation of the author's previous (and superior) big hit,
*The Martian*, in which an astronaut finds themselves unexpectedly alone on an
ambitious space mission, and has to science the shit out of things (by which we
mean deploy some high-school science trivia, along with a penchant for very
ordinary mental arithmetic) to save the day.

A badly written, distractingly unconvincing, and ultimately deeply annoying
collision between hard science fiction and hand-wavy nonsense, with no literate
themes, no higher meanings, no lurking Jungian archetypes - no mythology to it
at all. Just a succession of edge-of-the-seat will-he-or-won't-he survive tense
moments... Then: Yay, it worked, he did it! But *in space!*

Not even worth engaging the subjectivity-proof rating system for this one.

Rating: 2/10. I did finish it, but I wish I hadn't.
