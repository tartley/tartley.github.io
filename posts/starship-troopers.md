*by Robert Heinlein, 1959.*

My first time reading this classic old Hugo winner. I'd seen the 1995 movie
many years ago, which is clearly a satire, highlighting the fascistic
tendencies of the dedicated military discipline required for humanity to
survive in a dog-eat-dog galaxy.

But was that Heinlein's original intent? I don't detect that in my reading of
it. The text seems, to my eyes, to be a straight-up endorsement and
glorification of military discipline, corporal and capital punishment, and
withholding citizenship from people who haven't served in the military.

I've seen people argue that, as an expert writer, Heinlein knew precisely what
he was doing, and didn't need to draw attention to his critiques of fascism in
the text in order for an astute reader to realize that not everything espoused
by the novel is necessarily good, or corresponds with the author's viewpoint.
We are still discussing the novel 60 years later, and its relationship to
fascism, so he has achieved his goal of getting us to think about it. After
all, didn't Heinlein write this partway through his drafting of what would
become *Stranger in a Strange Land*, which features hippy sexual freedom, and
*Troopers* itself contains nods to racial and gender equality (albeit these are
somewhat ham-fisted.) Hence, say some, Heinlein was would not genuinely have
intended to advocate militaristic or fascist views.

I'm not convinced. It seems entirely possible that Heinlein was in favor of
sexual freedoms, while in other regards advocating staunch militarism. He
wrote *Troopers* directly in response to the US suspending nuclear weapons
testing, which he wished to see resume. According to Wikipedia he stated at the
time that he used the novel to clarify his military and political views, such
as that the USA was too conciliatory in its dealings with China and the Soviet
Union. In the book, the "bugs" - alien enemies, are explicitly referred to as
communist, and depicted as mostly mindless drones, for which the only solution
is eradication.

So. I don't agree with the author's outlook, and wasn't convinced by the book's
interpretation of civics, and passages of moralizing. But it was an
interesting, albeit naturally dated, read, to see what successful military
SF looked like 60 years ago.
