*by Jim Rossignol* (2009)

A gorgeous insider's look at videogaming culture, by an author who,
after an unfulfilling stint as a financial journalist, has built his
life around games.

Broken into sections corresponding with the author's experiences in
London, Seoul and Reykjavik, it's thoughtful and manages to sidestep the
patronising oversimplifications of mainstream media's gaming coverage.

From *Tetris* and *Elite* to *Okami* and *Shadow of the Collossus*,
stopping along the way to examine the modding and indie scenes, the
massively multiplayer intricacies of *EVE Online*, and the insane
heights of Korean real-time strategy matches. He knows the best *Prince
of* *Persia* was *Sands of Time*, by a country mile. He's one of us. I
felt welcomed to his world. Join us - we'll be on the sofa.

Rating:

10/10 if you understand that games have the potential to become the
dominant art form of the 21st century.

0/10 if it's just for kids, innit?
