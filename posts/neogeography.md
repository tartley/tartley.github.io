Over the summer I've been keeping a geographic journal of some of our
recent adventures:

- [The Minnesota project](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=114555587615190768594.00044fcb05ec0c0be2012&ll=45.540084,-93.44283&spn=5.809675,14.282227&z=7)
  : our summer in Blooming Prairie
- [CO to CA](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=114555587615190768594.000453372a3a9329df229&ll=37.431251,-110.786133&spn=13.158173,28.564453&t=h&z=6)
  : our summer roadtrip

It's an amusing journalling project for me, but as an exercise in
neogeography (the distainful term Geographic Information System pros use
to describe such upstart tools, popular with the great unwashed) I have
to say it's pretty forlorn. The editing tool is thoroughly annoying to
use, and the data model is none existant - you're simply crayoning
one-off symbols on top of the map, with no ability to relate any symbol
to any other, except by manually assigning them the same symbology. The
ability to import KMZ is little consolation if all the resultant data is
so unstructured. No doubt things will get better as GIS and neogeography
borrow each other's best ideas, but for the time being this exercise
left me disappointed.

I seem to recall that the editing tools in Google Earth are a smidgeon
better, but still profoundly lacking. Anyone got any ideas what I should
be using instead for personal 'for amusement' projects like this?
