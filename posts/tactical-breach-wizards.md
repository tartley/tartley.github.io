*In this house, we use the metric system. Released in 2024 by Suspicious Developments.*

I was toying with the idea of advancing the kiddo's videogaming curriculum into
a turn-based tactics phase, maybe starting with the genius of 1994's [UFO:Enemy
Unknown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFO%3A_Enemy_Unknown), on which I spent
endlessly fascinated evenings of my youth, or maybe one of the better of its
numerous sequels and offshoots. Somehow I was distracted from that plan by
multiple people enthusing about last year's [Tactical Breach
Wizards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_Breach_Wizards), and I'm so glad
that I was.

It is *such* a lovely, synergistic blend of gameplay mechanics, setting,
characters, story, plot-twists and whip-smart dialog, making substantial
improvements on the traditional bombastic and yet intensely thoughtful
turn-based formula.

First, it defuses the self-righteous seriousness of the genre's customary tone
by replacing the gurning muscle-bound military types with a bunch of special-ops
*wizards*. Still formidably competent, but now replete with pointy hats,
hazardous runes, and bejeweled wands protruding from their assault rifle
barrels. Further, while presenting a thrilling facade of enemies dispatched in a
dizzying flurry of rapid-fire magic, the game explicitly disavows wanton
killing. While one of our characters does sneer at the stance, your team is
revealed early-on to use only nonlethal take-downs. This is soon followed up by
a cut-scene which shows your team leaving a building after a mission, revealing
the enemies you earlier dispatched out of eighth floor windows floating gently
earthwards, each safely cocooned in a magical bubble.

Second, a fundamental mechanic bestows one of your characters with the gift
of magical foresight, allowing you to see the outcome of planned actions before
you actually commit to them. It's a slick narrative integration of a mechanic
that serves multiple purposes. Preventing the anguish of losing a character due
to dumb bad luck means the player is freed up to experiment more, trying
audacious plans rather than playing it safe. Then, when it all goes wrong, you
can rewind just a smidgeon, and try out nearby alternatives, until you have it
all *just* right, bouncing generative combos back and forth between characters,
unleashing staggering waves of action, discovering gleefully that a level you
initially thought to be an impossible slog is actually completable in a single
nimble turn. When combined with the inventive diversity of each character's
specific talents, it simultaneously presents real challenges, while allowing the
construction of surprising solutions that leave one feeling feeling incredibly
clever and creative.

It's not often worthwhile dwelling on the characters in a videogame, but here
they are the stars of the show. Distinctive, flawed and intensely likeable each
in their own way, with personalities and back-stories that resonate so
pleasingly with their in-game abilities. The writing is just top notch, with
phenomenal dialog, giving the group as a whole a fresh, wholesome and real-talk
vibe.

This is an all-time classic in my book, and has been fabulous to experience
alongside the 13 year-old kiddo, as we've each run parallel games through to
completion, ogling over each other's shoulders to get sneak previews of
encounters we haven't seen yet.
