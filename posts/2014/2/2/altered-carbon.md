*by Richard Morgan* (2001)

A romp through a hyperviolent cyberpunk future through the eyes of a
character reluctantly press-ganged into the role of detective in a story
woven around personality uploads, swaps, and backups. Thoroughly enjoyed
it, but it was never going to be life-changing.

10/10 if you're looking to kick back on the couch with tea, cake, and
some exciting SF.

0/10 if you're not.
