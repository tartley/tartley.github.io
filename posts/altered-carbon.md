*by Richard Morgan* (2001)

A romp through a hyperviolent cyberpunk future through the eyes of a
character reluctantly press-ganged into the role of detective in a story
woven around personality uploads, swaps, and backups. I did enjoy it,
but was put off by the main character winning their victories
by consecutive applications of remorseless violence. There's no cleverness
or examinations of morality here, just that the character cast as the "goodie"
triumphs by being better at beating people up.

10/10 if you're looking to kick back on the couch with tea, cake, and
some exciting SF.

0/10 if you're not.
