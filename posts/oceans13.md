![Don Cheadle in Ocean's 13](/files/2007/07/oceans13.jpg)

*Directed by Steven Soderbergh* (2007)
[imdb](http://imdb.com/title/tt0496806/)

I really, really loved 12, despite the Mockney accent. I thought the
script was just immaculate. I think I'm in a minority on that. Anyhow, I
really hated this one, with its witless Godfather references. Rubbish
all over. 3/10.
