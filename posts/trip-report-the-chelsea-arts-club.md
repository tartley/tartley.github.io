Dinner last night spent under the [beady
eye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Whistler-painter.jpg) of painter
[James McNeill
Whistler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McNeill_Whistler), founder
of the divine [Chelsea Arts Club](http://www.chelseaartsclub.com/),
courtesy of [Nicholas Furness](http://nixtasinks.nixta.com/) and his
Mum. Entertainment provided by the redoubtable mad Greek artist Renos,
gadget advice and cheap tech hand-me-downs from Greg, and a new massage
therapist, Elena, picked up along the way. A highly profitable evening,
methinks.
