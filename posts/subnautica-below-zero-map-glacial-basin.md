[Subnautica](https://subnautica.fandom.com/wiki/Subnautica_Wiki),
and its icy sequel,
"[Below Zero](https://subnautica.fandom.com/wiki/Subnautica:_Below_Zero)",
have perhaps been my favorite
games of the last few years. The majority of their run time takes place under
the colorful waters of an alien ocean. It's been a joy to sit side-by-size
with Zander for tense scuba cave dives, or piloting vehicles through
vertiginous underwater cave systems, headlights straining through the murk to
reveal wonders. It has inspired

Part of the games take place on land though. I *started* drawing a map of Below
Zero's Glacial Basin region just to keep track of where we'd been. To make sure
we visited all the locations, found all the MacGuffins (I'm looking at *you*,
pesky antidote), and experienced all that there was to experience.

But as those goals approached completion, I *finished* drawing it because it
had become a therapeutic experience. Happily exploring away, mesmerised by the
scenery, avoiding hostile wildlife, uncovering the ruins of ancient alien
artifacts. Reckoning distances by eye, scribbling down what we found, updating
and correcting the map as we went. Being lost in the experience. Simply a joy.

[Reddit is encouraging me](https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_Below_Zero/comments/qutkqz/hand_drawn_map_of_southern_glacial_region_wip/)
to tackle the tricky Actic Spires area, too. *&lt;Rubs hands&gt;...*
