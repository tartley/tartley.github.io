<p><em>by William Gibson, 1984.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So opens William Gibson's debut novel, and it is to his eternal credit that we
all still remember the line now, nearly forty years later. I don't usually do
audiobooks, but I made an exception for this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The bartender’s smile widened. His ugliness was the stuff of legend. In an
age of affordable beauty, there was something heraldic about his lack of it.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unlike the majority of the beloved science fiction of my youth, Gibson's
poetic, literary style has only increased in my estimation over the subsequent
decades.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of
legitimate operators, in every nation. By children, being taught mathematical
concepts. A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every
computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged
in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city
lights, receding.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The consensual hallucination might seem prosaic now, but one has to remember
this was written back when the internet connected less than 1,000 hosts,
accessed via green screen text terminals on university campuses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>He'd made the classic mistake, the one he'd sworn he'd never make. He stole
from his employers. [...] Of course he was welcome, they told him, welcome
to the money. And he was going to need it. Because — still smiling
— they were going to make sure he never worked again. They damaged his
nervous system with a wartime Russian mycotoxin. Strapped to a bed in a
Memphis hotel, his talent burning out micron by micron, he hallucinated for
thirty hours. The damage was minute, subtle, and utterly effective. For Case,
who lived for the bodiless exultation of cyberspace, it was the Fall. In the
bars he'd frequented as a cowboy hotshot, the elite stance involved a certain
relaxed contempt for the flesh. The body was meat. Case fell into the prison
of his own flesh.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He introduced the world to cyberpunk, combining the fatalistic noire of Blade
Runner with the relentless dehumanizing advances of a libertarian tech
dystopia, to create a startlingly original warning of our possible future that
looks, as the decades tumble by, increasingly on-the-nose.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A year here and he still dreamed of cyberspace, hope fading nightly. All the
speed he took, all the turns he'd taken and the corners he cut in Night City,
and he'd still see the matrix in his dreams, bright lattices of logic
unfolding across that colourless void... The Sprawl was a long, strange way
home now over the Pacific, and he was no console man, no cyberspace cowboy.
Just another hustler, trying to make it through. But the dreams came on in
the Japanese night like livewire voodoo, and he'd cry for it, cry in his
sleep, and wake alone in the dark, curled in his capsule in some coffin
hotel, hands clawed into the bedslab, temper foam bunched between his
fingers, trying to reach the console that wasn't there.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are several versions of Neuromancer as an audiobook. The slightly
abridged six-hour version <a href="https://archive.org/details/NeuromancerReadByWilliamGibson">available for free at the Internet
Archive</a> is notable
for two things: it is read by William Gibson himself, and it is an extremely
low quality rip from an audiocassette.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Night City wasn’t there for its inhabitants, but as a deliberately
unsupervised playground for technology itself. Like a deranged experiment in
social Darwinism, designed by a bored researcher who kept one thumb
permanently on the fast-forward button. Biz here was a constant subliminal
hum, and death the accepted punishment for laziness, carelessness, lack of
grace, failure to heed the demands of an intricate protocol.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The audio quality might make anyone immediately pass this version by. It isn't
just noisy, but features discernible wow and flutter - artifacts characteristic
of the stretching or uneven speed of its original tape based media.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>He closed his eyes. Found the ridged face of the power stud. And in the
bloodlit dark behind his eyes, silver phosphenes boiled in from the edge of
space, hypnagogic images jerking past like a film compiled of random frames.
Symbols, figures, faces, a blurred, fragmented mandala of visual information.
Please, he prayed, now- A gray disk, the color of Chiba sky. Now- Disk
beginning to rotate, faster, becoming a sphere of paler gray. Expanding- And
flowed, flowered for him, fluid neon origami trick, the unfolding of
distanceless home, his country, transparent 3D chessboard extending to
infinity. Inner eye opening to the stepped scarlet pyramid of the Eastern
Seaboard Fission Authority burning beyond the green cubes of Mitsubishi Bank
of America, and high and very far away he saw the spiral arms of the military
systems, forever beyond his reach. And somewhere he was laughing, in a
white-painted loft, distant fingers caressing the deck, tears of release
streaking his face.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I'd urge you to stick with it. For the author's reedy, Virginia-inflected
voice has a cadence that holds the attention. A rhythm of tone and emphasis
that, for me, works considerably better than the practiced glossiness of more
recent, more professional recordings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"The moment, I mean the nanosecond, that one of those things starts figuring
out ways to make itself smarter, Turing’ll wipe it. Nobody trusts those
fuckers, you know that. Every AI ever built has an electromagnetic shotgun
wired to its forehead."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the end of the second chapter, I'd stopped being bothered by the audio
quality, and by chapter three, it had become an intrinsic part of the
experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It was disturbing to think of the Flatline as a construct, a hardwired ROM
cassette replicating a dead man's skills, obsessions, kneejerk responses.<br>
[...]<br>
He slotted some ice, connected the construct, and jacked in.
It was exactly the sensation of someone reading over his shoulder.
He coughed.<br>
  "Dix? McCoy? That you man?' His throat was tight.<br>
"Hey, bro," said a directionless voice.<br>
"It's Case, man. Remember?"<br>
"Miami, joeboy, quick study."<br>
"What's the last thing you remember before I spoke to you, Dix?"<br>
"Nothin'."<br>
"Hang on." He disconnected the construct. The presence was gone. He reconnected it. "Dix? Who am I?"<br>
"You got me hung, Jack. Who the fuck are you?"<br>
"Remember being here, a second ago?"<br>
"No."<br>
"Know how a ROM personality matrix works?"<br>
"Sure, bro, it's a firmware construct."<br>
"So I jack it into the bank I'm using, I can give it sequential, real time memory?"<br>
"Guess so," said the construct.<br>
"Okay, Dix. You <b>are</b> a ROM construct. Got me?"<br>
"If you say so," said the construct. "Who are you?"<br>
"Case."<br>
"Miami," said the voice, "joeboy, quick study."<br>
"Right. And for starts, Dix, you and me, we're gonna sleaze over to London grid and access a little data. You game for that?"<br>
"You gonna tell me I got a choice, boy?"<br></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A distortion so thoroughly appropriate to the underlying material
it was as though Gibson had planned it this way all along, speaking directly to
me via a weak signal, projected through time by the noisy filters of this
obsolete electro-mechanical recording mechanism. The words at once clear and
irrevocably decayed, fuzzy sounding but still stark and unmistakable in their
meaning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Dixie?"<br>
"Yeah."<br>
"You ever try to crack an AI?"<br>
"Sure. I flatlined. First time. I was larkin', jacked up real high, out by Rio heavy commerce sector. Big biz, multinationals, Government of Brazil lit up like a Christmas tree. Just larkin' around, you know? And then I started picking up on this one cube, maybe three levels higher up. Jacked up there and made a pass."<br>
"What did it look like, the visual?"<br>
"White cube."<br>
"How'd you know it was an AI?"<br>
"How'd I know? Jesus. It was the densest ice I'd ever seen. So what else was it? The military down there don't have any thing like that. Anyway, I jacked out and told my computer to look it up."<br>
"Yeah?"<br>
"It was on the Turing Registry. AI. Frog company owned its Rio mainframe."<br>
Case chewed his lower lip and gazed out across the plateaus of the Eastern Seaboard Fission Authority, into the infinite neuroelectronic void of the matrix. "Tessier-Ashpool, Dixie?"<br>
"Tessier, yeah."<br>
"And you went back?"<br>
"Sure. I was crazy. Figured I'd try to cut it. Hit the first strata and that's all she wrote. My joeboy smelled the skin frying and pulled the trodes off me. Mean shit, that ice."<br>
"And your EEG was flat."<br>
"Well, that's the stuff of legend, ain't it?'</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Five out of five stars. A riveting performance.</p>
