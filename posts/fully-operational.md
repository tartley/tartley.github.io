Now witness the power of this fully armed and operational battle station.

![My desk featuring too many computers](/files/2023/desk-with-computers.webp)

New job means new laptop means it's time to clean and re-org the desk.

Leftmost blue skies
: Linux laptop (a free hand-me-down from a job ten years ago). Acting as the
house Plex / streaming media server, usually tucked away more discreetly than
this.

Left top green forest
: Heavy duty work / gaming Linux laptop ("hardware bonus" from my last
employer). Has been my primary work machine, but sounds like it's getting
replaced by...

Left bottom spaceship drawing
: Macbook Pro (Brand new! Just unwrapped yesterday. Thank you new employer
Lambda!)

Left bottom, under the Mac
: You can sort of see the 10" whiteboard I use to combat ADHD by writing a
sentence about what I'm *supposed* to be working on, then I can spot it every
few minutes and drag my mind back to the task in hand. (a technique described
in the fabulous [Self Command by Chris
DeLeon](https://gamkedo.gumroad.com/l/self-command/).

Center
: Main monitor and wireless tenkeyless mechanical keyboard & mouse combo, all
switchable to any of the laptops. Under the keyboard you can sort-of see the
"Magic the Gathering" gaming mat (free from local gaming store's MtG lessons)
pressed into duty as the world's most gigantic, beautiful, and luxurious mouse
mat.

Right monitor, keyboard and mouse
: are wired to the Windows gaming PC under the desk (not visible). The kiddo's
current [Astroneer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/361420/ASTRONEER/)
session is visible. The monitor is switchable to any of the laptops.

Right tab
: Absolute workhorse 12.6" Android tablet on which I do most of my reading, laid in the picture here just to be gratuitous.
