I had the good fortune to attend the [Academic IT
Festival](http://www.sfi.org.pl/news) over the weekend, in Cracow,
Poland. Pictured below is the audience listening to Chad Fowler, Ruby
and Rails guru, who I had the pleasure to discover is also a really nice
and interesting guy.

The festival is organised by a large group, including former Resolver
legends Jan and [Konrad](http://konryd.blogspot.com/), and covers a
diverse array of IT and related topics. It is the largest event of its
type in Central Europe. Some talks were in English, some in Polish, by
an absolutely stellar line-up of luminary speakers, including Joe
Armstrong, creator of Erland; Gilad Bracha, co-creator of Java; plus
yours truly. See 'one of these things is not like the others.'

There's some photos up [here](http://www.sfi.org.pl/gallery/index.html),
and I'll publish my own updated Test-Driven Development talk here later
today.

**Update:** There's
