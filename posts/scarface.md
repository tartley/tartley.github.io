*Director: Brian de Palma (1983)*

Oh, I don't know, my expectations were too high or something. I expected
an intense study of greed, corruption and criminal will. Maybe I'm
desensitized. All I found was that it frequently descends into simply
camp 1970s gunfight scenes. Amusing to note the influences it has had on
other media, particularly the mansion in *Grand Theft Auto: Vice City*.
I couldn't find much else to commend it.
