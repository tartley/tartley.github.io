![The Straight Story](/files/2007/07/thestraightstory.jpg)

*by David Lynch* (1999) [on amazon.co.uk](http://imdb.com/title/tt0166896/)

Aw, heck, I dunno. It's kinda down to Earth and charming, but also plain
and slow-moving. And sure, that was deliberate, it wanted to tell a
simple, powerful story in the terms of its protagonists, within the
context of rural life. But I couldn't really get into it, despite really
wanting to. Some of the acting was a bit lacking. IMDB informs me that
it's a true story. Fair enough. It's still 4/10.
