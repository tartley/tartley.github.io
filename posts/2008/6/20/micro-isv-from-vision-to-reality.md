Finally got around to plucking this off the shelf, and yes it's an
interesting grab-bag of things to think about, and case studies of
people who have taken the plunge. But there's not very much in here
that's significantly unexpected. The chapter about business formalities
says 'yes you should create a business plan', but has no guidance about
how to go about that.

All in all then, a nice checklist to make sure you're not overlooking
anything too obvious, but it didn't feel like the in-depth detail I was
hoping for.
