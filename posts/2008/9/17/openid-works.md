I've always been
intrigued by [OpenID](http://openid.net), while simultaneously being
repulsed by the identifiers that I thought users were forced to adopt.
Seeing one too many strings like:

> https://me.yahoo.com/a/.DuSz\_IEq5Vw5NZLAHUFHWEKLSfQnRFuebro-

tossed around made me think I'd have to adopt a username like that,
which obviously is never going to wash, for aesthetic and typability
reasons alone.

Fortunately [Ned Batchelder's
rant](http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200809/openid_is_too_hard.html),
leading me to [Simon 'Zeppelin' Willison's demystifying blog
post](http://simonwillison.net/2006/Dec/19/openid/), taught me all about
how to use your own URL as your OpenID equivalent of a username, by
inserting some HTML onto your web page. So now I've managed to jump
through the sign-up hoops required to get me one of those
globally-unique OpenID username identifiers for myself:

There. That isn't too painful, is it? Since I got set up, it has proven
lovely to use. Get on board!
