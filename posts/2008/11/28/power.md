*by Bertrand Russell, 1937*

A jolly good romp through the ways in which power has manifested in
human society throughout the millennia, the sources from which those
powers derived, such as kingly fiat, religious fervour, nationalism or
revolutionary unrest, and the ways in which power may be transformed
from one type, such as from economic power to leadership, by means of
propaganda. All these aspects are discussed in the historical context of
their occurrence, with comparative references to the bewildering 'modern
day' - a world on the brink of the second world war, and concluding in a
heartfelt appeal to sanity in an attempt to avoid war,  isery and
subjugation. An entirely worthy tome in all senses of the word.

Rating 8/10.
