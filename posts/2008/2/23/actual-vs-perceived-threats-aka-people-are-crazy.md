[![Actual vs Perceived threats](/files/2008/02/0aelecrtromshjoi9.jpg)](http://www.susannahertrich.com/html/humansanimals.html)

[Susanna
Hertrich](http://www.susannahertrich.com/html/humansanimals.html) has an
art / thesis project to artificially stimulate people's threat
perceptions (by giving them goosebumps, or making hairs stand on end) in
response to *actual* threats, as opposed to perceived ones. It's a topic
that I'm unnaturally preoccupied with, since the most egregious examples
of the disparity between the two seem to intrude on my life every day.
My opinions about whether any given threat is real or illusiory seem to
differ from almost everyone, but I'm going to stubbornly cling to the
idea that everyone else is crazy. Take the entry on 'terrorist attack'
as an example (see diagram.) Public reactions to the topic remind me of
nothing so much as a stirred-up ants nest, a psychotic, ineffectual
frenzy.
