*33 essays, edited by Andy Oram*

I was wondering how to explain why I didn't like this book as much as I
thought I would - possibly as much as I thought I *ought* to. Thirty-odd
genius bitwranglers delving into their favourite bits of code - surely
it must be *packed* with fabulous insights into the zen of programming.
But something about it left me flat, and I was having trouble putting my
finger on why. Fortunately Jeff Atwood's ever brilliant *Coding Horror*
has saved me the bother, by [explaining it
perfectly](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001062.html).

Programmers love code. It is the culmination of their labours. It's not
just a document or a diagram, but is a dynamic, living record of their
conceptual jujutso. But to focus on the code itself, in a variety of
languages, which few readers are likely to be familiar with all of, is a
relatively superficial theme, and comes at the expense of the abstract
designs that the code embodies, and of the features and capabilities of
the languages themselves.

Rating 6/10: Contains some gems, but generally falls between two stools.
