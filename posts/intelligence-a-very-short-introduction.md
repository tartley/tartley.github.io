*by Ian J. Deary (1st Ed, 2001)*

An expert's overview for the layman, describing how and why people differ in
their thinking powers, Very data driven, and by necessity, largely driven by
consideration of how to measure different aspects of intelligence, and
therefore what aspects intelligence can be teased apart into, such as working
memory, or speed of operation.

Each chapter tackles a key scientific question, such as the effects of
genes vs the environment, or the ways in which intelligence declines as we
age.

It's a short book, with a lively style, densely packed with important
conclusions, and descriptions of how researchers have arrived at them.
Edifying and entertaining in equal measure.
