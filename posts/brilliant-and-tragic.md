Susan was on the phone to the phone company the other day. She couldn't
verify her identity as the account holder, because the phone service in
question was actually bought by me, as a gift. Because of this, the CSR
declined to give her any information, not even publically available
stuff like their customer service phone number. When gently quizzed
about the rationale behind that, the CSR responded with a newspeak-laden
pitch about the heightened-security society in which we live. It was
like that moment in Fight Club, when Norton suddenly realises "Ah! I
geddit! You're a *moron*."

Unfortunately, our society consists of CSRs like this. They are [the
people we depend on](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/quotes). They
cook our meals, they haul our trash, they connect our calls, they drive
our ambulances. They guard us while we sleep.

And they are being *brainwashed* by the current climate of terrorist
hysteria, Kafka-esque security checks, idiotic travel restrictions, the
[TSA's Constitution-free
zone](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080131-tsa-blog-smackdown-explain-to-me-about-bomb-juice.html),
into believing that a security state (and an [ineffectual
one](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/01/tsa_misses_the.html),
at that) is a good and desirable thing. It just makes me want to break
down and weep and go and live on an island somewhere.

And then - my ray of hope - every so often you find things like this...
