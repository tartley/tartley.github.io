<p><em>by Samuel Delaney, 1975</em></p>
<p>It broke me. I need to take another run up to this. Advice welcome.</p>
<p><a href="http://localhost:8000/categories/did-not-finish/"><span style="background:grey; color:white; border-radius: 1em; padding-left: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em; padding-top: 2px;">did-not-finish</span></a></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Well, I did finish it eventually. It took me five months, and three
attempts in the end, along with the reading of countless notes, critiques and
analyses to keep my comprehension and engagement up. For my own sanity, I'm
going to attempt a quick summary of the plot.</p>
<p></p>
<center>✻  ✻  ✻</center>
<br><p>The main character, Kid, is not simply an unreliable narrator, but is actually
delusional. Or he might be. His sanity remains unknowable. The city of Bellona's
physical environment is deadly unpredictable, laws of cause and effect no longer
apply, and the sense of chaotic unreality permeates everything. The social order
is gone, as people wander from one encounter to the next, making friends or
enemies or lovers on an hour-by-hour basis. Everyone is vulnerable to rape and
death at the hands of the literally monstrous Scorpion gangs.</p>
<p>Kid discovers a notebook, containing unsettling entries which, glimpsed,
are very similar to passages from the novel we are reading. Perhaps it is
an alternate draft? These entries might, or might not be, Kid's own writings.
He is unable to tell, as time loops and memory collapses. Regardless, he
contributes further to the journal, and these entries are presented in duelling
columns, as equal peers to the action, as alternate resolutions, entire
different sequences of events, or metafictional commentary upon what "actually
happened".</p>
<p>Kid is drawn into a Scorpion gang, at first reluctantly, but then rising to
prominence amongst them for his crazy, heedless bravery. Mythological portents
contribute to a sense of dread anticipation of a cyclic, apocalyptic frenzy,
which subjectively comes about as Kid's mental condition - or the legibility
of reality - deteriorates towards the novel's end.</p>
<p>The final words of the duelling channels presented by Kid's notebook end in
mid-sentence, which is completed by the novel's opening, forming the promised
cycle.</p>
<p></p>
<center>✻  ✻  ✻</center>
<br><p>I'm not sure I'm up to drawing conclusions on top of that without lifting them
wholesale from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Certainly I must admit that I found it hard work. It's difficult for me to
discern what it is about this text which I found unrewarding, versus, say, books
by David Mitchell like <em>number9dream</em>, which I loved. Perhaps in number9dream,
I felt like I was in on the joke, because I was able to clearly identify
distinct strands of metafiction and moments of unresolvable ambiguity, wherein
one perspective might shift impossibly into another, but each instance of this
is, with thought, separable from the rest of the novel.</p>
<p>Whereas <em>Dhalgren</em> has a denser tapestry of prickly ambiguity. No part or level
of the fiction can be relied upon, from the largest of characterisations of the
main character, to the tiniest of descriptive detail. All is in flux,
misdirecting, unreliable, making a casual reading just confusing, while a
careful reading is the same, but more so.</p>
<p>In reading around, I discovered that Delaney repeatedly spoke about Dhalgren as
an attempt to convey his experiences living with dyslexia and dysmetria - an
inability to perform co-ordinated bodily movement - together with his time on a
mental ward during a breakdown, and his repeated episodes of seeing destroyed
urban landscapes that nobody else could perceive. Because of this, part of me
feels as though the novel might just be an exercise in confusion. An attempt to
simulate the helplessness of mental illness by undermining all aspects which the
reader might otherwise have felt they could rely on.</p>
<p>This does, in principle, seem like a worthy experiment - and I'm sure this is
only part of what such a relentless, ambitious work is attempting. But on the
other hand, it makes me think that some of the more positive reactions to
Dhalgren might just be from readers who perceive, in the chaos, a grand
meaningful structure that simply isn't really there. Throw enough noise at a
filter, and the resulting output signal is not a function of the noise on the
input, but is instead characterized entirely by the filter.</p>
<p>It seems ironic to me that perhaps the most vehement of the book's many
detractors is Philip K. Dick, who described it as "trash". I would have
said Dhalgren closely resembles the kind of profoundly unsettling departures
from realism that came from Dick channeling his own mental illness. Evidently
I'm wrong.</p>
<p>Evidently, I'm wrong.</p>
