*by Chris DeLeon (2018)*

Roman Emperor Marcus Auralias' notes, traditionally titled *Meditations*,
are a foundational text for practical Stoicism. They comprise a multitude of
observations and recommendations, grouped into sections such as "Keeping
thoughts tranquil", and "Cooperation, collaberation and contribution". They
offer advice for living a contented life, with less regret, sorrow, anger and
fear.

Several translations exist, themselves dated from through the ages. This book
combines them, to synthesize a text which doesn't hew as precisely to the
original as a straight translation might, but is instead intended to have the
most relevance to modern ears.

Confession: It's taken me *months* to get through it. Partly this is because
I've allowed myself to be distracted by more gaudy and immediate books along
the way. Partly it's because I found the best way to read this was *slowly*.
Practically every paragraph is worth reflecting upon, to consider how it
applies to my own life, and ponder what practical, specific next steps are
implied.

If I had to criticize, it would only be the superficial wrinkle that there's
a lot of repetition, such as hundreds of suggestions to not fear death.
Apparently the original documents were accumulated over decades of Auralias'
life.

Genuinely life changing.
