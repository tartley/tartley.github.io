*by Aldus Huxley, 1954*

> *"...the draperies are living hieroglyphs that stand in some peculiarly

A fairly standard trip report then, albeit one from a relatively astute
and articulate 1950s traveller. Presumably this will therefore be exactly as
fascinating or tedious as the prospect of such a thing leads you to expect.

**Update:** I forgot to mention the amusing trivia that this is the
essay [Jim Morrison's band](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_doors) was
named after. Did everyone know this except me?

Rating 6/10 : No truer nor more deeply insightful word has ever been
written in the English language. Yawn.
