*Directed: The Coen Brothers, 1996.*

Some brilliant performances, some lovely moments. Emminently watchable.
Interesting point, I don't know about Fargo itself, or The Dakotas, but
the fine residents of Minnesota will insist that they neither sound or
act like the depicted characters, which is of course absolutely
charming. (love you guys! :-)
