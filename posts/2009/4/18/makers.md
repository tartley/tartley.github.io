*by Cory Doctorow* (not yet published.)

[Cory](http://craphound.com/) very kindly brought an early manuscript of
this as a gift to [Michael](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/),
[Giles](http://www.gilesthomas.com/) and I when we met him a while ago,
and I've been wracked with guilt ever since because I apparently lost it
soon after. Thankfully, it recently turned up (on
[Christian](http://babbageclunk.com/)'s desk - my fault!) last week, so
I happily finished it pronto.

It's his best fiction yet! He must be honing his abilities with
practice. \\o/ Michael do you want it next?.

Christian doesn't like my subjectivity-proof rating system, so this one
is specially for him.

Rating:

10/10 if you want a lightly styled but deeply speculative and engrossing
story that winds a like a sightseeing tour around the social and
personal ramifications of the ways in which modern technology is
changing the way people interact, organise and get things done.

0/10: If you aren't interested in the ways society is changing under our
feet.
