A haunting and melancholic tale set in a mythical post-Arthurian England,
populated by ragged peoples, affected by a pervasive amnesia. Elderly couple
Axl and Beatrice abruptly decide to leave their village of damp, hobbit-like
underground burrows to visit a son they'd forgotten they had.

Other characters are inspired by a variety of sources, from Beowulf to Arthur's
knight and nephew Sir Gawain, now old and prone to quixotic rants - hinting at
the subconscious conflict his code of honor has with the dark means by which he
and other knights helped Arthur achieve the current uneasy peace between native
Britons and invading Saxons, now occupying villages across the land.

The journey is perilous, encountering roaming ogres and deadly pixies, not
to mention soldiers of the local lords, and deadly conflicts within the party
itself.

But any action is relayed with cool distance. Either through the pervasive
mental fog, or using expert fighters' clinical analysis of the minutia of
stance or grip, or by foretelling the ebb and flow of a battle by analysing the
terrain, then allowing the battle itself to take place off stage, only assumed
to have happened, by characters who weren't there.

This muted indirectness is entirely in keeping with the ambiguous, dreamlike
style of the book, which is heightened by the sing-song formalism of the
characters' speech, and the narrator's occasional surreal hint of relating this
tale to contemporaries who live in some other, unidentifiable, historic time.

The journey eventually comes to revolve around the dispatch - or defence - of a
dragon that is said to be the source of everyone's forgetfulness, and as this
goal approaches, vague fears surface of what might be remembered when the
mist lifts. Will Axl and Beatrice's treasured relationship survive the
revelations of their pasts? Will the longstanding truce in the land survive
the remembering of wartime battles and atrocities? Will Saxon resentment at
Arthur's desperate misdeeds be stoked into resumption of the violent war of
invasion? This is left unresolved by the novel's end, but as reader, we know
that the Saxons did ultimately conquer all of England, displacing the Britons
culturally and politically, and possibly murdering a good number of them along
the way.

Personally, I'm minded to think of ancient England here as being the root of
modern Western culture, and the mist as an allegory for the bland ignorance of
our own culture's atrocities. The deliberate forgetting, like the mist, clouds
all our conciousnesses, making it hard for us to remember who we are. Why we're
here. The silent resentment of crushed minorities and genocide survivors forms
a pressure, struggling against the placating narrative that everything's OK
now. But, contained, the pressure builds.

Truly a buried giant, indeed.
