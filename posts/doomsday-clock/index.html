    <p><em>By Geoff Johns (writer), Gary Frank (pencil) &amp; Brad Anderson (colors). (2017-2019)</em>
<img alt="Spoilers" src="../../files/spoilers.svg"></p>
<p>The original <a href="https://archive.org/details/Watchmen1987"><em>Watchmen</em></a>, is a
seminal 12-issue superhero comic by Alan Moore (writer) &amp; Dave Gibbons
(artist), published from 1986 to 1987, that transformed the comics world. A
superhero tale in which <em>almost</em> none of the superheroes have any superhuman
powers.</p>
<p>The decades since have spawned a number of remakes, sequels, prequels and
spin-offs. Zach Snyder's movie adaptation has its adherents, and the HBO
miniseries sequel was, in my opinion, excellent. But other than that they have
not been very good. I initially thought the 12 issue sequel <em>Doomsday Clock</em>
comic would fall solidly into this group, and passed it by when it came out
a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>But on reading it last week, I really enjoyed it. It really swings for the
fences, providing a smashing tale, with good arcs for both old and new
characters, and a genuine attempt to advance the conversation that <em>Watchmen</em>
started by deconstructing the superhero.</p>
<p>We last saw Dr Manhattan at the end of <em>Watchmen</em>, having been isolated from
humanity by Adrien Veidt's plans, tired of his entanglement in the messy
complexity of people's lives, threatening to leave the galaxy "for one less
complicated".</p>
<p></p>

<br><p>Adrian Veidt, genius that he is, invents a means to follow Dr Manhattan,
seeking his help, and various other <em>Watchmen</em> characters make their way, or
are transferred to, the DC universe. This has been described across the comic
industry as "the crossover event nobody wanted", but personally I felt it was
really well done.</p>
<p>Two of the most prominently deceased <em>Watchmen</em> characters are brought back
into play, using mechanisms I thought were legitimate and, on occasion,
laugh-out-loud satisfying as they reached their resolution.</p>
<p></p>

<img alt="Doomsday Clock Watchmen Comedian Alive" src="../../files/2022/doomsday-clock-comedian.webp">
</center>
<br><p>In particular, they find a way to bring back Rorschach. Or, at least, <em>a</em>
Rorschach. This seems like the most controversial of the many decisions in the
book, but it's handled deftly, and there are both similarities and differences
between the old and the new Rorschach, making it an interesting character in
its own right. In some ways this transformation is reminiscent of HBO
Watchmen's treatment of Hooded Justice - retaining everything we already knew
about the character, but performing an astonishing piece of narrative ju-jitsu
to utterly transform everything about what that meant.</p>
<p>The DC heroes slowly realize their world is being altered by Dr Manhattan's
manipulations, tying this crossover into the latest of the DC universe's
"crisis" events, as Manhattan experiments with this reality, in order to
understand it. In doing so, he uncovers deep truths that affect the
inter-relationship between all the DC time-lines and universes, establishing
that historical stories, such as Superman's original appearance in Action
Comics of the 1930s, represent realities that still exist, out in the
multiverse, unaffected by subsequent re-ploughing that forever drives
Superman's origin story further forward in time over the years. All these
worlds, including the various DC pre-crisis worlds, are accessible to
Manhattan's powers.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this enables DC to undo the changes wrought by the last few
years unpopular "new 52" era: The Justice League's alternate roster, the early
death of Clark's parents, which distances Superman from humanity and changes
the character dramatically, the loss of the Justice Society of America from
Earth, and the loss of Wally West's Flash. All these and more are written off
as the effects of Dr Manhattan's meddling, isolated and preserved in just
another spun-off part of the multiverse, and jettisoned from the privileged
<em>metaverse</em>, the core template from which all multiversal threads are forged,
as it reverts to more-or-less its former state when Manhattan's changes are
undone during <em>Doomsday Clock</em>'s story.</p>
<p>In doing all this, Manhattan exhibits his usual clinical detachment from the
human consequences of his actions, setting himself up as the villain of the
piece, an uncaring "being of inaction", in contrast to Superman, the literal
"man of Action" (Action comics, that is).</p>
<p></p>
<center>
<img alt="Doomsday Clock: Superman &amp; Manhattan" src="../../files/2022/doomsday-clock-superman.webp">
</center>
<br><p>This forms a genuine riposte to <em>Watchmen's</em> criticism of the superhero genre.
Yes, the DC heroes inhabit a simpler world, but there is a mythological power
in what they represent as symbols. Particularly the value of <em>hope</em>, as
personified by Superman, which - quite literally, in this tale - makes all
other things possible.</p>
<p>I was also really pleased with the places Doomsday Clock goes with <em>Mothman's</em>,
back-story. The character in <em>Watchmen</em> was little more than a punchline,
recurring throwaway references to mental instability and alcoholism. But here
we see him fully-fleshed out. Like all-but-one of the <em>Watchmen</em> heroes, bereft
of any magical superhuman powers, but still able to pull off entirely unexpected
and superhuman-seeming stunts, merely by virtue of possessing their own unique
kinds of extreme mental or emotional resourcefulness, and working very hard at
it.</p>
<p>Flawed, but aware of his faults, and able to pull it together to be a beacon of
warmth, kindness, and generosity which transforms the path of Rorschach II, who
he befriends during their overlapping stay in a mental institution - a symbol,
if you will, that just as <em>Watchmen's</em> ruthless gaze influenced the wider world
of comics, so the comic world gazes back. They see us, all the real-world,
fully-rounded humans, trapped in the depths of our pathos, and they wonder,
when will each of us find our means to <em>fly...</em></p>
