    <p><em>By Geoff Johns (writer), Gary Frank (pencil) &amp; Brad Anderson (colors). (2017-2019)</em></p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/Watchmen1987"><em>Watchmen</em></a> is a
seminal 12-issue superhero comic by Alan Moore (writer) &amp; Dave Gibbons
(artist), published from 1986 to 1987, that transformed the comics world. A
superhero tale in which all-but-one of the superheroes have no superhuman
powers at all.</p>
<p>The decades since have spawned a number of remakes, sequels, prequels and
spin-offs. Zach Snyder's movie adaptation has its adherents, although I am not
among them - one of Moore's goals was always to explore what makes the comic
medium unique, developing and advancing the boundaries of what you can do in
a comic but cannot do in other media. For example, a reader absorbs a comic at
their own pace, and will often voluntarily flip back to clarify overlooked
aspects of recent panels. What use, then, a shot-for-shot remake in the medium
of video, which steamrolls the viewer along, heedless of their desire to
cross-check important details? The HBO miniseries sequel, on the other hand,
was excellent - better than I imagined any Watchmen sequel could be. But other
than that they have not been very good.</p>
<p>I initially thought the 12 issue sequel <em>Doomsday Clock</em> comic would fall
solidly into this group - indeed, it was decried by many review headlines,
so I passed it by when it came out a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>But on reading it last week, I really enjoyed it. It really swings for the
fences, providing a smashing tale, with good arcs for both old and new
characters, and a genuine attempt to advance the conversation that <em>Watchmen</em>
started by deconstructing the superhero.</p>

<p>We last saw Dr Manhattan at the end of <em>Watchmen</em>, having been isolated from
humanity by Adrien Veidt's plans, tired of his entanglement in the messy
complexity of people's lives, threatening to leave the galaxy "for one less
complicated".</p>
<p></p>

<img alt="Manhattan's departure at the end of Watchmen" src="../../files/2022/doomsday-clock-watchmen-manhattan.webp">
</center>
<br><p>In <em>Doomsday Clock</em>, Adrian Veidt, genius that he is, invents a means to follow
Dr Manhattan, seeking his help with the re-emergence of imminent nuclear war
brought about by the revelations in Rorschach's journal, and it becomes clear
that the "simpler place" Dr Manhattan has journeyed to is the DC universe,
populated by Superman, Batman, and the <em>whole</em> stable of DC heroes.</p>
<p>Various other <em>Watchmen</em> characters make their way, or are transferred to, the
DC universe. This has been described across the comic industry as "the
crossover event nobody wanted", but personally I felt it was really well done.</p>
<p>Two of the most prominently deceased <em>Watchmen</em> characters are brought back
into play, using mechanisms I thought were legitimate and, on occasion,
laugh-out-loud satisfying as they reached their resolution.</p>
<p></p>

</center>
<br><p>In particular, they find a way to bring back Rorschach. Or, at least, <em>a</em>
Rorschach. Another individual picks up the mask. This seems like the most
controversial of the many decisions in the book, but it's handled deftly, and
there are both similarities and differences between the old and the new
Rorschach, making it an interesting character in its own right. In some ways
this transformation is reminiscent of HBO Watchmen's treatment of Hooded
Justice - retaining everything we already knew about the character, but
performing an astonishing piece of narrative ju-jitsu to utterly transform
everything about what that meant.</p>
<p>The DC heroes slowly realize their world is being altered by Dr Manhattan's
manipulations, tying this crossover into the latest of the DC universe's
"crisis" events, as Manhattan experiments with this reality, in order to
understand it. In doing so, he uncovers deep truths that affect the
inter-relationship between all the DC time-lines and universes, establishing
that historical stories, such as Superman's original appearance in Action
Comics of the 1930s, represent realities that still exist, out in the
multiverse, unaffected by subsequent commercial re-ploughing that forever
drives Superman's origin story further forward in time over the years. All
these worlds, including the various DC pre-crisis worlds, are accessible to
Manhattan's powers.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this enables DC to undo the changes wrought by the last few
years' unpopular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_52">"New 52" era</a>. This
meant nothing to me when I started reading, I know basically nothing about
American comics, only being familiar with the fabulous British
<a href="https://2000ad.com"><em>2000AD</em></a>. I was spurred into reading around the DC lore,
and by the time I was done, I understood that the <em>New 52</em> reality included
things like
<a href="https://www.cbr.com/justice-league-darkseid-war-guide/">The Justice League's alternate roster</a>,
the
<a href="https://www.cbr.com/superman-ma-pa-kent-deaths/">early death of Clark's parents</a>,
which distances Superman from humanity and changes the character dramatically,
the loss of the Justice Society of America from Earth, and the loss of Wally
West's Flash. All these and more are written off as the effects of Dr
Manhattan's meddling, isolated and preserved in just another spun-off part of
the multiverse, while being jettisoned from the privileged <em>metaverse</em>, the
core template from which all subsequent multiversal threads are forged, as it
reverts to more-or-less its former state when Manhattan's changes are undone
during <em>Doomsday Clock</em>'s story.</p>
<p>In doing all this, Manhattan exhibits his usual clinical detachment from the
human consequences of his actions, setting himself up as the villain of the
piece, an uncaring "being of inaction", in contrast to Superman, the literal
"man of Action".</p>
<p></p>

</center>
<br><p>This forms a genuine riposte to <em>Watchmen's</em> criticism of the superhero genre.
Yes, the DC heroes inhabit a simpler world, but the simplicity serves a purpose.
Escaping the mundane enhances the mythological power of what they represent as
symbols. Particularly the value of <em>hope</em>, as personified by Superman, which,
although possibly somewhat overwrought in the telling - quite literally, in
this tale - makes all other things possible.</p>
<p>I was especially pleased with the quiet, understated places Doomsday Clock goes
with <em>Mothman's</em>, back-story. The character in <em>Watchmen</em> was only a punchline,
a recurring throwaway reference to instability and alcoholism, telegraphing his
subsequent mental breakdown. But here, we see him fully fleshed out.</p>
<p>Like the rest of the <em>Watchmen</em> heroes, he has no magical superhuman powers,
but is still able to pull off entirely unexpected and superhuman-seeming
stunts, merely by the virtue of his own unique kind of extreme mental and
emotional resourcefulness. Flawed, but aware of his faults, and able to pull it
together when he needs to, he befriends the younger Rorschach II during their
overlapping stays in a mental institution, becoming a beacon of warmth,
kindness, and generosity to the younger man.</p>
<p>He acts as a symbol, if you will, that just as <em>Watchmen's</em> ruthless gaze
influenced the wider world of comics, so the comic world gazes back. They see
us, all the real-world, fully-rounded humans, trapped in the depths of our
pathos, and they wonder, when will each of us learn to transcend our humdrum
limitations, to finally act on our hopes and dreams, and <em>fly...</em></p>
