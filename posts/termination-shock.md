*by Neal Stephenson, 2021*

It's another 700-page doorstop from the much-beloved author. It was enjoyable,
but not life changing. Not as compelling as some of his previous. Reads a lot
like a narrative wrapped around the author's own personal justifications for
pro-active geo-engineering projects. Which, I have to admit, I was pretty
horrified by the idea when I first heard about it - meddling further with a
critical and horrifically complex dynamic system that we don't undertand, and
all that.

The story presents the the scenario of countering the temperature rise caused
by CO2 in the atmosphere by releasing high altitude sulphur dioxide, to reflect
sunlight back into space. This mitigates many of the most prominent effects of
climate change, such as high-temperatures, storms, forest fires, and sea-level
rises.

It further presents the idea that it's relatively easy and cheap to do, and
some nation or part thereof that cares the most - e.g. The Netherlands, or

Venice, amongst others, will either take a crack at it, or else will cease to
exist. So we might as well get used to the idea and be prepared for what,
geopolitically, happens after that.

I don't know if it's simply the story making me increasingly familiar with the
idea, or whether the depiction of the mechanism genuinely quells some of my
worries, in that it seems easy to start at a small scale, monitor the results,
scale up as required, and the fail-safe is that the sulphur should quickly fall
out of the air, allegedly harmlessly, if we realize this was a bad idea. I've
at least tempered my initial harshly negative viewpoint somewhat. So, mission
accomplished, I guess?

I've probably read more text by Stephenson than any other writer. Hmmm. By

<br />

Ten thousand pages, all from one author, or fifteen thousand if you include
re-reads. Not bad! The number of re-reads is a reasonable proxy for the impact
each book had on me at the time.

But on reflection, there is another contender...
