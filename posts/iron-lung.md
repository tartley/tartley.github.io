New work meeting background just dropped!

Invited to view the movie at Pop's with Phil and Sarah, I crammed the game from
start to finish the night before, with Zander watching disdainfully over my
shoulder every step of the way.

Both are tense and engaging, but clearly only for a particular kind of viewer.
The game itself has a very narrow focus, as befits a single-person indie
production. This means you'll only really enjoy it if you're dorky enough to
fixate on the mechanic of cross referencing your submarine's map co-ordinates
sufficiently hard to orient your way around a whole system of underwater
trenches. Every step of the way you negotiate your way past unseen but deadly
canyon walls by dead reckoning alone, a tense enough exercise even without the
proximity alarms. On top of that, strange noises and... other interuptions...
when they drop, are technically relatively tame and limited, but in context,
entwined in the co-ordinate grind, they are experienced as shocking and panic
inducing.

Similarly, I enjoyed the movie, but I see reviews are all over the map. Clearly
some don't have patience for its limited scope - 99% of the runtime takes place
with one character in a single room. But I found it taut and thrilling. Some
patches of unclear dialog softened the high-concepts thrown around, but for me
it was always an experience of style and vibes anyway.
