*by Harold Pinter, 1958.*
*Directed by Ian Rickson.*
*At the National Theatre's Lyttelton theatre.*

As I was forewarned is typical of Pinter, difficult to untangle a point,
but nevertheless both chilling and amusing in turns. Having said that,
I'd really have to go and read all about it before I could decide
whether I actually liked it or not, which I guess means that currently I
don't. 4/10
