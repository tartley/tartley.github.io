![PyCon UK 2007 view from the front](/files/2007/09/pycon.jpg)

Had a marvellous time at [PyCon UK
2007](http://pyconuk.org/index.html), a conference about the
[Python](http://python.org) programming language. In the event everyone
from [Resolver](http://resolversystems.com) bar one of our directors
went along. We met loads of great and interesting folks, heard many
excellent talks, and gave a few of our own:
[Michael](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/index.shtml) talked
about [driving Microsoft's natty new Silverlight technology using
IronPython](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/ironpython/webide/webide.html).
Giles talked about his concept of the *New Age of the Amateur:
End-user Computing without Tears*, and I gave a little talk about
test-driven development for beginners, which can be downloaded here:
