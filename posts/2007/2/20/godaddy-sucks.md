In the 36 hours since embarking upon this ill-considered plan to
jump-start *tartley.com*, it has became increasingly apparent that
[godaddy.com](godaddy.com), the cheap-as-chips host I hurriedly opted
for earlier in the year, sucks *McSuckety* suck-suck.

Let's hope [these guys](http://laughingsquid.net/) are somewhat better.
Planned photo gallery will have to wait until I get switched over. I
think I could even qualify for their 'starving artist' discount!
