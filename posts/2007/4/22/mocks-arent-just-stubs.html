<p>My exposure to test-driven software development at Resolver Systems has
resulted in a tremendous enthusiasm for the idea. Doubtless a
significant proportion of my zeal stems from my own over-compensation
for arriving late to this particular party, but nevertheless, I truly
believe that it's the most significant evolution the craft of software
engineering has had in decades. For thirty years we've had good reason
to believe Brooks' assertion that there will be no silver bullet, and
now I can't shake the feeling that this is the closest thing to it that
we'll ever have any right to expect.</p>
<p>After hearing suggestions from
<a href="http://andrzejonsoftware.blogspot.com">Andrzej</a> on improving our use of
mock objects in our unit tests, I did a little reading around the ideas
he mentioned. One of the best essays I found was Martin Fowler's piece,
entitled <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">mock objects aren't
stubs.</a></p>
<p><img alt="Mock classes used in unit tests as stubs." src="../../../../files/2007/04/mocks-arent-stubs.png"><em>Class UnderTest, shown on the left in use by release software, and on the
right in a test environment, using stubbed out mock helper classes.</em></p>
<p>Clearly, the idea of a generic mock object class isn't a brand-new one,
and Martin's essay describes several such utilities that have been
around for various lengths of time, but it is something I hadn't really
thought about until this week. We do use mock objects in our tests at
Resolver, in the sense of stub classes. When our class-under-test calls
methods on other 'adjacent' classes, then the test will first substitute
some mock object, often defined on the spot, to replace the adjacent
class. This decoupling of the class-under-test from other adjacent
classes keeps the tests simple and orthogonal.</p>
<p>If these mock objects had no methods on them, then the class under test
would barf when it tried to call methods on the mock. So we add empty
stub methods on the mock, to mimic the method names present on the
adjacent class it replaces.</p>
<p>This conventional kind of test works well. State changes within the
object-under-test can easily be asserted. Also, state changes to other,
mocked objects cannot be directly tested, since the simple stub mocks
described above maintain no internal state. In a way, this is fortunate,
since such state changes to adjacent objects should not be tested, or at
least not by the test under discussion. Those state changes should be
implemented by method calls on the adjacent objects, and tested in the
adjacent object's own unit test instead.</p>
<p>However, this only emphasises how important it is that, as well as our
own state changes, we should also be testing the behaviour of our
object-under-test by asserting that it makes the correct method calls to
adjacent objects. Not all method calls should be tested though - they
can be split into two categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Method calls made to calculate state changes in the current
    object-under-test.</li>
<li>Method calls made to inform other objects that they need to update
    their own internal state.</li>
</ol>
<p>Method calls belonging to the second category need to be explicitly
tested for. At Resolver we often implement such tests using a 'Listener'
test pattern, which can be used to assert that a given method on an
adjacent object was called with the correct arguments. Martin's essay
describes a generic mock object class that can be instructed to assert
that particular methods on it were called with particular parameters,
and this seems like a convenient pattern, particularly the methods which
create appropriately named stub methods on the mock object based upon a
given class. We could, I think, use this idea at Resolver in places, if
only to cut down on the manual creation of stubbed-out mock classes
throughout our test code.</p>
<p>However, the method of testing-by-behaviour that Martin describes does
not seem to always be applicable. The first of the two categories of
method calls above can and should be tested for by looking soley at the
resultant state changes in the object-under-test. It is these state
changes which are important, not the methods used to effect them.
Asserting that various helper classes were used to make an internal
state change only makes the test needlessly brittle to alternative
implementations that achieve the same result.</p>
