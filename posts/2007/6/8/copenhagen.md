![Flag of Denmark](/files/2007/06/flagofdenmark.png)

Spent last weekend in lovely Copenhagen, courtesy of our
native guide, Susan's friend Rasmus. The ever genial Witt Mathot, and
his sidekick Mike, were also in town giving some GIS Server training
course. Consequently I spent Monday sickasadog. Quite possibly I will
never be the same again. Regardless, the city was terrific and its
inhabitants warm, genuine and kind, even after an [outrageous
travesty](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/6715785.stm)
inflicted by Sweden on the football pitch. Hurrah for bastions of
civilisation, even though their politicians are, by all accounts, going
down the pan just as fast as ours are. Through the whole weekend, I only
said 'Dutch' when I meant 'Danish' once, which by my standards makes me
a beacon of informed, considerate enlightenment. Defining memory:
Pleasant post-party walks home through the city in the dawn sunlight,
amongst streams of happy, chatting, cycling people all doing the same.
