A friend of a friend puts his artistic endeavours online, and what do I
do? That's right, I frak with it. Presenting, [Diet Guru
Plus](/files/2007/03/diet-guru-plus.jpg "Diet Guru Plus"),
brought to you courtesy of the well-known 'mashup' copyright exception.
Hurrah for the de facto creative commons!
