Announcing the first draft of our white paper, [The Case For Forward
Error
Correction](/files/2007/03/caseforforwarderrorcorrection-v113-16mar2007.pdf "The Case For Forward Error Correction.pdf")
(PDF), outlining many of the revolutionary technical features which we
leverage in our current project. I'll be submitting it for presentation
at the proceedings of the British Computing Society, and at the ACM
later this year. Many thanks to all of the contributors - getting this
far has been a lot of work, With special thanks to
