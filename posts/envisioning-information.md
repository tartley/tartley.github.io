*by Edward R. Tufte* (1990)

In much the same vein as Tufte's *The Visual Display of Quantitative
Information*, and displaying the same calibre of deeply incisive
common-sense that cuts to the heart of all that's right and wrong about
the art and science of 'information design' - graphic design's more
pragmatic nephew.

If you love beauty in highly functional graphics, from maps and
diagrams, charts and graphs, tables and typography, then this is for
you.

Rating:

10/10 If bad diagrams make you cringe, and good ones make you laugh out
loud.

0/10 If you only care about beauty, but not about usefulness. Or if you
don't have eyes.
