Dear Julio,

Many thanks for considering me for this opportunity. I feel as though my
skills are a good match for the position, and would like you to consider
my application.

I feel as though this is the start of a new phase in life for me, as
though I have really rounded a corner. I have not used a computer, but
my nephew says he will meet me tomorrow afternoon to teach me how to do
it. Also, my therapist says that my bouts of incoherent rage will
continue to diminish, so that will be good in my new job. My probation
for stealing from my previous employer is almost up.

I am high, but I can absolutely have this under control and be
completely sober by Monday, when I trust you will call me at your
earliest convenience.

Best regards,

Jonathan Hartley
