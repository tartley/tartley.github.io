![Chiwetel Ejiofor's Othello](/files/2008/01/othello372.jpg)

Another of my occasional theatre trips inspired by [the
Libster](http://libbypenn.com), and jolly lovely it was too. Being a bit
of a cultural dolt, I've neither seen nor read Othello before, so while
everyone else was basking in the familiarity of well-crafted dialog, I
was alternately on tenterhooks or else all choked up, bless.

Chiwetel Ejiofor (left), known to me only through his part in the
geekspasm of Serenity, presented a warm and charismatic Othello, which
served to highlight his later descent into jealousy and madness. The
treachery of Ewan McGregor's Iago seemed unjustified within the context
of the play itself - is it to be assumed that Iago is motivated by
simple racism, or something more explicitly framed which passed me by?
Nevertheless, McGregor's Shakespearean debut seemed to me to be a
compelling performance.

I enjoyed the director's use of light and shadow to represent various
locations, as well as the acoustics, which augmented several of Iago's
scheming monologues with an imperceptible bass rumble, which gradually
rose to a ominous distant roaring, as though the engines of his inner
demons were fit to burst through the walls. I also fancy I caught
changes in the properties of a very gentle electronically injected
reverb on the actor's voices, to model the auditory properties of each
scene's environment, which provided subtle but deeply suggestive cues as
to the size and type of each setting, from small stone rooms, large
wooden halls, through to outdoor environments deadened by foliage.

Rating: 8/10 - Hurrah I loved it!
