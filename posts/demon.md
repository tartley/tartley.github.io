*by Jason Shiga (2016)*

I'm just discovering the works of [Jason Shiga](http://www.shigabooks.com),
creator of mathematically-inspired nonlinear comic-books, e.g. stories drawn
on complex origami structures, that can be folded in various ways to represent
either branching story-lines, or else to manage state such as 'inventory'.
Construction of these more elaborate paper constructions doesn't scale,
(ie. I'm not likely to ever own one) but you can try some of his other
creations on the web.

This is [Demon](http://www.shigabooks.com/index.php?page=001),
a regular linear web-comic.

The storyline is 'math-inspired' too, in the same way that the movie *Primer*
is - intense, absolute, ruthless, narrative exploration of logical
implications, while continually, dizzyingly, escalating to the next level.
