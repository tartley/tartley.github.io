| Tommy prepares for the ultimate lesson in personal mortality. |

<br />

*Writer/Director: Darren Aronofsky.Starring: Hugh Jackman, Rachel Weisz. (2006)* [![Internet Movie Database](/files/2007/03/imdb.png)](http://imdb.com/title/tt0414993/)

*What if you could live forever?*

Writer and Director Darren Aronofsky has a fierce and original talent,
as amply demonstrated by his previous successes, *Pi* and *Requiem for a
Dream*. Had I realised that *The Fountain* was another one of his, then
perhaps I would have been marginally more prepared for it. In actuality,
caught dozing my way through an aeroplane flight one sunny afternoon, I
was somewhat blindsided by this millennia-spanning story of love, death
and rebirth.

The thing is, it doesn't feel like Aronofsky's previous titles. It does
feel a lot like other audacious, wildly sentimental tales, such as
Crowe's *Vanilla Sky*, or Soderbergh's *Solaris*. Doubtless it will
polarise viewers. Those of a more cynical bent will snigger at the
pretentious triple-stranded narrative, encompassing characters separated
by a thousand years, caught in the endless struggle for life amidst
death. Good friends of mine, no doubt, will leave theatres in droves,
gagging at the na√Øve rediscovery of the original Garden of Eden's tree
of life in the jungles of Guatemala, steeped in Aztec legends of
sacrifice and afterlife. Many will cringe at the grand and operatic
scope of the emotionally crushing, drug-inspired finale, as Hugh
Jackson, now a 25th century space-faring guru, full-lotuses headlong
into a nova for the ultimate lesson in personal mortality.

But for every person who just can't stand a movie like this, there will
be others who are bold and foolish enough to fall head over heels for
its brand of unrepentantly teary-eyed intensity. For those bright-eyed
space cadets, who have immense reservoirs of willing suspension for a
story that is at once both enormous and intensely personal, who strive
to enlarge their conciousness, or to be unafraid of the darkness in our
hearts, and most especially for those who are or who ever have been in
love, I can unreservedly say that it's the most amazing film of the
year. And if you love it too, then then maybe one day we will find, that
"together, we can live *forever*."

Well, maybe. But at the very least, it would make for a smashing film.

Rating: 9/10
