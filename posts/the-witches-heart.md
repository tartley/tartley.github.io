Another fantastic Suze recommendation.

Old Norse mythology only briefly mentions the witch
[Angrbo√∞a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angrbo%C3%B0a),
as the mother of three "monsters", fathered by the trickster god, Loki. This
book explores her life, explicitly acknowledging her erasure as a woman, and
resolves it, providing her a powerful story, in which she survives men, gods,
and all.

Loved it.
