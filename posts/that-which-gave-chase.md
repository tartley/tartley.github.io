*Released in 2023, played on Linux in 2024.*

Mush your dog sled across cruel Arctic wastelands, driven onwards by a rude and relentless companion, who hired you to take him back to some remote spot, where it becomes apparent he had some sort of revelation, or maybe a breakdown.

The low-res, dithered presentation conveys the harsh, blinding conditions, as you struggle to make out details through the relentless wind and ice. Smash cuts between day and night disorient you, the days and nights blur into one another, leaving you only fragmentary, disjointed memories of days on the ice, or nights around the huts, repeatedly collapsing into crude bunks, righting the sled again while your companion curses you for a fool, or silent moments alone, outside in the dark, before you both mount the sled before dawn. The sense is of endless, exhausting time spent covering the distance, through punishing conditions, and it's surprisingly evocative.

The narrative leans into the disorientation, making nothing clear. Your companion becomes
increasingly cryptic. He urges you onward, resting in wooden huts along the way, but starting out
before dawn the next day. The deer behave increasingly strangely. Your companion regales you with
sickening tales of the investigative mistreatment he subjected them to on his previous visit. By the
time the strange mushrooms come into play it is very obvious that you are in a place to which you
should never have come, very far from anywhere or anyone, with mounting dread, alone with with a
madman. What happened the last time he took this route? What did he leave behind here? What awaits
at your journey's end?

Doesn't outstay its welcome, all done in an hour, but the memories remain.
