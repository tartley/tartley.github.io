I've never before memorized the complete set of tricks needed to solve a
rubik's cube... until today! My first completion with no reference to my notes
took 3 minutes and 5 seconds. Wine and chocolate motivators as pictured.

Rubik's cubes first came out outside Hungary in 1980, when I was 9. A year or
two after that, I got my hands on an nth generation photocopy of handwritten
instructions for solving one, derived by a mathematically-inclined friend of a
friend of my Dad. (The things we used to do before the internet!)

I memorized the first few phases, so have always been able to do the first two
layers. But the last parts of that solution involved remembering a couple of 15
or 20 move sequences, which apparently ten-year-old me got bored of, or
distracted from, before ever committing to memory.

It turns out that
[the modern "beginner's method"](https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/how-to-solve-the-rubiks-cube-beginners-method/)
that I'm reading about today is considerably simpler than that, and is
much easier to understand and memorize. So now that lingering childhood
inadequacy is vanquished.
