Fabulous short story, [Lena](https://qntm.org/mmacevedo) by qntm, riffs on
[SCP](http://www.scpwiki.com/)'s idea of a work of fiction as a wiki entry.
But this is entirely standalone, not part of the SCP universe, and more
resembles a Wikipedia entry. Seems both genuinely scary and almost inevitable.
