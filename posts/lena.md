Fabulous short story, [Lena](https://qntm.org/mmacevedo) by qntm, riffs on
[SCP](http://www.scpwiki.com/)'s idea of a work of fiction as a wiki entry.
But this is entirely standalone, not part of the SCP universe, and more
resembles a Wikipedia entry. Seems both genuinely scary and almost inevitable.

The title stems from the image above, head-and-shoulders hurriedly torn from
the centerfold of a colleague's issue of Playboy in 1972, while searching for
an image to use in an image processing conference paper. From this, we can
infer the proper pronunciation is *Lenna*, as in the name of the model.

This image has been widely re-used in scientific journals for decades. It has
some objectively useful properties - good dynamic range, details and flat
regions, shading and texture. However, its viral popularity most probably stems
overwhelmingly from its racy nature, featuring an attractive woman, used in
male-dominated fields. This was in contrast to other common test images of
the time, derived from dull 1960s television standards work.

The common long term use of the image was done without the knowledge or
permission of Playboy magazine - the copyright holder - or Lena herself. Over
the years they each became aware of it, and made their peace with it. By 2019,
though, Lena stated that the image, like her, ought to be retired.
