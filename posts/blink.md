*by Malcome Gladwell (2005)*

Blink is by the same guy who wrote *Tipping Point*, which I never read,
and was another foolish airport buy, induced by the sheer peer pressure
of it being popular. It features enough content to fill three or four
fairly interesting blog posts about the under-utilised ability of the
subconscious mind to come to rapid decisions which are sometimes
inordinately useful but rarely trusted in our left-brain dominated
society. This was then padded out to the length of an entirely
unnecessary paperback. 3/10.
