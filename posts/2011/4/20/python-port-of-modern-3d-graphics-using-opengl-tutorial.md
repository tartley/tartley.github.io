To my knowledge, there are three online OpenGL tutorials which stand
head and shoulders above the rest:

-   [Learning Modern 3D Graphics Programming Through
    OpenGL](http://www.arcsynthesis.org/gltut/index.html) (C)
-   [An intro to modern
    OpenGL](http://duriansoftware.com/joe/An-intro-to-modern-OpenGL.-Table-of-Contents.html) (C)
-   [Learning
    WebGL](http://learningwebgl.com/blog/?category_name=lessons)
    (Javascript)

I recently started porting the first of these from C to Python.

This is primarily for my own benefit, and I've only done the first two
chapters thus far, but others may find some use in seeing the
translation. If anyone else is interested enough to want to contribute,
drop me a line and I'll happily grant commit rights.
