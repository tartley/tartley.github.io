*Written by Alejandro Jodorowsky, art by Jean Giraud (aka Mœbius), 1980-88*

This creative pairing also worked together on
[the unproduced 1970s movie of Dune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodorowsky%27s_Dune),
the one whose cast was to have included Salvador Dalí, Orson Welles,
Gloria Swanson, and Mick Jagger, and presumably would have been pretty trippy -
I mean, *even more* trippy than the David Lynch one turned out to be. The
artist, Mœbius, has had a long and glorious career, knighted for his art in his
native France, and he worked on other movies such as Alien, Tron, The Fifth
Element, and The Abyss.

I grabbed this in the English translation from the original French, having been
intrigued by the *Pocket Essential Alan Moore*'s description of it as a
contender for "the best comic in the medium's history".

Echoes of all of these are visible throughout the consistently stunning
artwork of The Incal, and it has been explicitly noted as an influence on the
expansive decayed futurescapes of Akira and Blade Runner, the flamboyant
visuals of the Star Wars prequels, and even the concept of that iconic
technological terror, the "War Star", which can atomize a solar system in
seconds.

The writing really swings for the fences, a sprawling tale of a reluctant
hero's journey, taking in societal commentary, intergalactic travel, spiritual
transformation, iconic incarnations of good and evil, and a deep thread of
mysticism.

For me, it does have a very evident "foreign" feeling - small social nuances
with which I'm unfamiliar. Equally clearly, this is part of its exotic charm.
And while the story touches on, perhaps even consists of, deep themes, it
doesn't so much articulately explore them, but instead simply incorporates
them. This is not a comic for people who are not already comic fans.

In lesser hands, it might have been undisciplined. But wherever the story
roams, the artwork is endlessly enthralling. I especially liked the touch of
protagonist, John DiFool, starting out distinctly ugly, but being rendered more
handsomely on the rare occasions he manages to get in touch with his more noble
aspects. Jodorowsky manages to keep it all together, bringing it around to a
splendidly satisfying theatrical close. *Bravo!*
