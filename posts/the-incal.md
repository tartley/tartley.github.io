*written by Alejandro Jodorowsky, art by Jean Giraud (aka Mœbius), 1980-88*

I grabbed this in the English translation from the original French, having been
intrigued by the *Pocket Essential Alan Moore*'s description of it as a
contender for "the best comic in the medium's history".

This creative pairing also worked together on the unproduced 1970s movie of
Dune, the one that was to have featured Salvador Dali, and presumably would
have been pretty trippy. Mœbius has had a long and glorious career, knighted
for his art in his native France, and he worked on other genre movies such as
Alien, Tron, The Fifth Element, and The Abyss.

Echoes of all of these are visible in The Incal, throughout which the artwork
is consistently stunning. With hindsight, it looks like the leading edge of
waves that subsequently shifted the whole industry, from the expansive decayed
futurescapes of Akira and Blade Runner, to the flamboyant visuals of the Star
Wars prequels.

The writing really swings for the fences, a sprawling tale of a reluctant
hero's journey, taking in societal commentary, intergalactic travel, spiritual
transformation, iconic representations of good and evil, and a deep thread of
mysticism.

For me, it does have a very evident "foreign" feeling - small social nuances
with which I'm not familiar, but equally clearly, this is part of its exotic
charm. And while the story touches on, perhaps even consists of, deep themes,
it perhaps it doesn't explore them very articulately.

In lesser hands, it might have been undisciplined. But, come rain or shine, the
artwork is endlessly enthralling, including touches such as the protagonist,
John DiFool, starting out distinctly ugly, but being rendered more handsomely
on the rare occasions he manages to get in touch with his more noble aspects.
Jodowosky manages to keep it all together, bringing it around to a splendidly
satisfying theatrical close. *Bravo!*
