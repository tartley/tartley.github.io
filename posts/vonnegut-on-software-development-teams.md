So here's a thing. Spotted this in some of Kurt Vonnegut's personal
correspondence, talking about an instructor of his named Slotkin:

> What Slotkin said was this: no man who achieved greatness in the arts operated
> by himself; he was top man in a group of like-minded individuals. This works
> out fine for the cubists, and Slotkin had plenty of good evidence for its
> applying to Goethe, Thoreau, Hemingway, and just about anybody you care to
> name.
>
> If this isn't 100% true, it's true enough to be interesting—and maybe helpful.
>
> The school gives a man, Slotkin said, the fantastic amount of guts it takes to
> add to culture. It gives him morale, esprit de corps, the resources of many
> brains, and—maybe most important—one-sidedness with assurance.

Reminds me powerfully of my growing impressions of the environment a person
needs to be in in order to do great things in software. There is no doubt some
effectiveness in assembling great individuals to create a great team.

But in my personal experience, there is a whole lot _more_ value in creating a
great team by instilling the right values, and then watching the members
visibly level each other up, producing a succession of great individuals,
and only subsequently attracting more of the same.
