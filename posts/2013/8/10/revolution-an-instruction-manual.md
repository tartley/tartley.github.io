When you have a government that operates without limits, who proclaims
the right to arrest, torture and kill anyone, anywhere, with no
warrants, no trial, no due process...

When you have a government that militarizes the police and grants the
armed forces the power to operate with impunity within your own borders
and beyond. A government that views you, the people, as the enemy, and
treats you as such...

When you have a government that lies to you takes you into wars of
aggression, toppling country after country, killing hundreds of
thousands of innocent civilians, and sending your sons and daughters and
your fathers and your brothers home in flag draped coffins, or
disfigured and broken in mind and body, their lives destroyed in wars
that serve only to line the pockets of a unelected cartel of bankers and
corporations...

When you have all of this right in front of you, so blatant, so clear,
you shouldn't have to be convinced that both parties in this political
puppet show are owned and operated by the same interests. You shouldn't
have to be convinced that these overrated corporate popularity contests
that some call elections are distractions that will achieve nothing.
With this understood, you shouldn't have to be convinced that the system
you are living under must be brought to a halt.
