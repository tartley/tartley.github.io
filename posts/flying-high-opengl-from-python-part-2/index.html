<p><em>Last time we got as far as creating some instances of our super-simple

infrastructure to create some more interesting geometries, which means

<h3><strong>Composite Shapes</strong></h3>
<p>In order to create more complex shapes by composing instances of
existing ones, we need a simple composite shape:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MultiShape</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">children</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">matrices</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">child</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">pos</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">orientation</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">children</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">child</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">matrices</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Matrix</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pos</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">orientation</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre>
<p>A MultiShape contains a list of child Shapes, and a matrix for each
child, indicating the child's position and orientation relative to the
MultiShape's front-and-center.</p>
<p>This is probably as good a point as any to confess that for the purposes
of this demo, I ended up writing my own Matrix class, along with my own
Orientation class. Even my Vec3, which earlier I showed you defined as a
named tuple, gradually started to sprout some methods, until it became a
fully-formed custom vector class. This was pretty silly - it easily
doubled the size of my code-base, and while it felt like rewarding and
productive work, it was actually a waste of time. With hindsight, I
should have predicted this would happen, and started out using an
existing library for things like this, such as Euclid or Numpy. Way it
goes.</p>
<p>Anyhow, if a Multishape is going to be usable wherever a Shape is
currently used, it needs to provide the same interface, which luckily is
very simple - it just needs to provide iterables of vertices, faces and
face_colors. Here is how MultiShape provides a sequence of vertices, by
chaining the vertices of all its children, each vertex transformed by
the matrix of the relevant child shape:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nd">@property</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">vertices</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="n">matrix</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">transform</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">vertex</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">child</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">matrix</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">zip</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">children</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">matrices</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">vertex</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">child</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">vertices</span>
    <span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>There is an inefficiency to this. When MultiShapes are nested, I'm
transforming each vertex once for every branch in the tree. It would be
cheaper to just multiply the matrices of nested MultiShapes, and then
have the top-level MultiShape apply the resulting transforms to the
vertices of each of its children. However, we're only performing this
work at application start-up, not every frame, so I'm choosing to eat it
for the sake of simple-as-possible code.</p>
<p>Similar properties are defined on MultiShape to provide sequences of
face indices and face_colors, by aggregating those of its children.</p>
<p>Using MultiShape, we can now easily compose groups of our basic Shapes.
A new factory function composes a bunch of cubes into the same
MultiShape:</p>

<p>This is just starting to look a bit like a thorny geometric mushie trip, which
in this context I'm counting as a success.</p>
<p>If we can compose basic shapes into rings, we can also compose rings

<p>If you look carefully, you can make out some depth-buffer fighting where the
three rings intersect, but I'm moving too fast to worry about that now.</p>
<p><img alt="Tri-axis rings" src="../../files/2010/07/screen-tri-ring.png"></p>
<p>Because we're drawing each MultiShape using a single iteration of the
Render.draw() loop, we've massively reduced the overhead in drawing each
Shape, so we can easily add all of these at once into the world at
60fps, although it does form a bit of a visual cacophony:</p>
<p><img alt="All the rings, plus some other stuff" src="../../files/2010/07/screen-all-rings-etc.png"></p>
<p>I wonder how much stuff we can add into a MultiShape before it starts to
affect the framerate? Let's investigate... How about a spherical glob of
red blood cubes:</p>
<p><img alt="A glob of red blood cubes" src="../../files/2010/08/screen-glob-red-cubes2.png"></p>
<p>It turns out I can get about 14,000 cubes (168,000 triangles)
<a href="#update">[1]</a> into a single MultiShape like this before the framerate
starts to drop. I'm still rendering these as regular ctypes arrays, not
OpenGL vertex buffers (I don't think my hardware supports that), so all
the geometry is being sent needlessly over the bus to the GPU every
frame.</p>
<p>How about an alternative, the RgbCubeCluster:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">RgbCubeCluster</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">edge</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">cluster_edge</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">cube_count</span><span class="p">):</span>

<p>This creates a cluster of cubes, each one colored by its position in RGB
space.</p>
<p><img alt="An RGB cube cluster" src="../../files/2010/07/screen-rgb-cluster.png"></p>
<p>We still have enough <em>oomph</em> left over to dive the camera right into the
midst of the RgbCubeCluster and reveal that all the previous stuff is
still in the world too:</p>

<h3><strong>Recursively Generated Geometry</strong></h3>
<p>Can we make any more interesting recursively-defined geometry? The first
thing I thought of (no doubt this has been done many times before) was
the 3D equivalent of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_curve">Koch curve</a>:
Take a tetrahedron, and for each face, embed a new, smaller tetrahedron
sticking out of it. Recursively repeat this for each of the new smaller
triangles that have been formed.</p>
<p>The first time I coded this, successive iterations literally replaced
every new surface triangle that was formed by the process, with an
arbitrary break after eight or so iterations. I was quite surprised by
the result, which turned out to look like a slightly corrugated cube. At
first I naturally assumed that a bug in my code was the cause, but after
a period of contemplation, I realised this was the correct geometric
result. The reason for it can be seen in this Wikimedia diagram of the
first three iterations of forming a Koch surface:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../files/2010/08/Koch_surface_0_through_3.png"></p>
<p>The first iteration replaces every triangle by sticking a new
tetrahedron out of it - exactly as I had done for every face of my
original. The next iteration sticks smaller tetrahedrons onto every new
surface, and the edges of these new, smaller tetrahedrons all line up
with each other, to form long, contiguous straight seams in the
resulting shape. By the third iteration (the final one shown here) the
end result is becoming apparent. Each successive iteration merely
reduces the size of the ridges - the overall shape of the surface is
unchanged.</p>
<p>I modified my algorithm to only replace the triangular faces of the
newly-formed smaller tetrahedrons, rather than replacing every
triangular surface, and the result is this more pleasing snowflake
shape.</p>
<p><img alt="A Koch tetrahedron" src="../../files/2010/08/screen-koch-tetra.png"></p>
<p>This algorithm is about 60 lines of code. A similar operation can be
done on a cube, by poking a new, smaller cube out of each of its faces:</p>
<p><img alt="A Koch cube" src="../../files/2010/08/screen-koch-cube.png"></p>
<p>The deeper red parts are the original cube and the early generations of
children. The lighter yellow parts are the later generations.</p>
<p>The final and best example in this section was supplied by Oscar
Lindberg, who was interested enough on my old blog post about this to
download the code and produce some shapes of his own. Screenshots can't
do it justice, but the full stately geometry becomes wonderfully
apparent when it's in motion. The <em>tetrix</em>, aka the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle">Sierpinski
tetrahedron</a>:</p>

<h3><strong>Odds and Ends</strong></h3>
<p>That's about all I've got to show you. Overall I'm really pleased by
this, and excited to do some more of the same going forward.</p>
<p>You may have noticed I've cheated a little in the demo / screenshots -
some of them show clear evidence of the rudimentary lighting shader I
added (e.g. topmost faces are slightly lighter in color than other
faces.) It would be simple enough to fake this, by providing slightly
varying colors for each face of our shapes, but for those of you looking
at the code: I didn't do that. Instead, I had Glyph generate arrays of
surface normals, which is done by Glyph.get_glnormals(), which works
pretty much just like all the other Glyph methods we examined in part 1.
I was getting tired of explaining how Glyph worked, so I figured you
were probably getting tired of it too, and wouldn't mind if I skipped a
little which wasn't strictly necessary.</p>
<p>I was initially a little disappointed by the performance at rendering
many independently positioned and oriented objects, but now it's picked
up (see footnote [1]) and is now perfectly acceptable: a little
over 450 separately moving cubes at 60fps. The OpenGL bindings in
PyOpenGL wisely choose to prefer correctness and robustness over
performance by default, so as a result, calling OpenGL from Python is
not fast out of the box. The <a href="http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/documentation/">PyOpenGL
documentation</a> suggests
many ways in which this performance can be regained once your program is
working and debugged. I'm not yet using any of these suggestions, so
hopefully my sluggish performance could be improved substantially.</p>
<p>In addition, Richard Jones suggested that the innermost Render.draw()
loop could possibly benefit from <a href="http://www.cython.org/">Cython</a>
(optional static typing to be added to code written in a less-dynamic
subset of Python.) This would not just improve the general performance
of the code in that loop, by actually compiling it to C, but in doing
so, it would eliminate the Python / C boundary performance penalties,
and this is something I'm excited to try out in the near future.</p>
<p>[1] <strong>Update:</strong> A couple of hours after hitting publish on
this, I discover that switching from the PyOpenGL bindings to those
built into pyglet gives me two to four times the frame rate, for zero
code change except the imports. Clearly I don't understand how to get
the best performance out of PyOpenGL. I've been back and updated the
performance stats in this post, and hope to make another post about this
at some point when I understand what I was doing wrong.</p>
