*Dark days are coming.*

I saw this weeks ago but never got around to a write-up, from which you
might guess it was a little disappointing. Which is a tragedy, because
the *reason* it was disappointing is that it has so much potential. It
strives to do the right thing, exploring the psychological extremes felt
by a crew of eight on a year-long mission to the Sun, the fate of the
world on their shoulders. Aspiring to emulate Kubrick, both thematically
and visually, it alludes to humankind's search for God, the character of
Searle being driven over weeks to increase his exposure to the
unfiltered ravages of the sun, until, when other characters are fried to
a crisp outside the ship, he grabs the comm, frantically asking "Kaneda,
what do you see? *What do you see?*"

But the allusions are too tenuous, too infrequent, and never followed up
on. The inspirations drawn from
[*2001*](http://imdb.com/title/tt0062622/) and from 2002's
[*Solaris*](http://imdb.com/title/tt0307479/) shine brightly, but
Sunshine doesn't come close to emerging from their shadow.

When things are brought to a head in the final third of the movie, it
all descends into plain old slasher flick territory, utterly wasting the
careful set-up of the earlier scenes. There's an interesting use of
cinematographic blur and flicker, which retain the tension by never
clearly showing what the remaining crew are up against, and also to my
reading, serving as a palpable visible expression of the furious,
searing madness that exudes from an individual who has spent far too
much time in the sun.

Once all that is done, the final, final scene contains some redemption.
But it's too little too late. I don't remember the last time I saw so
many beautiful scenes, so terribly wasted.

Rating 5/10.

**Update:** I wish I could have put it as eloquently as [this guy
did](http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2007/07/chemical-radiance-review-of-film.html).
