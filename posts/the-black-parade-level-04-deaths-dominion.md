So. Looking Glass's seminal 1998 PC game *Thief: The Dark Project* spawned an active and long-lived
modding community, who created hundreds of fan-made extra levels, many of which are extremely artful
and creative.

One group of particularly obsessed loons spent seven years crafting an extraordinary set of such
levels, forming an entirely new single-player campaign for the game, named *The Black Parade*. This
was released last year and I only just became aware of it. I'm four missions in, absolutely loving
it, and completely lost in the catacombs beneath the pseudo-medieval city.

Hence, my lovingly hand-drawn map of mission 4, Death's Dominion:
