*by Greg Bear, 2010*

A smashing hard SF tale, about the existential mystery of life aboard a
generation starship that has lost its way. Following in the footsteps of
classic variations, such as _Non-Stop_, _Methusalah's Children_, and _Tau
Zero_, it centers around the character's revelations as they uncover their
situation and origins, being decanted to order by warring factions amongst
high technology ruins.
