‰ or _'per mille'_ means parts per thousand.

I wasn't aware of it until today when I idly Googled "permil", my imagined
variation on "percent", to find that this is one of the many spellings of
a real thing. Rarely used in English, but more common in other European
languages.

Now that I see the symbol, I remember seeing it as a child, on an old
typewriter that my Grandfather used. What's old is new.
