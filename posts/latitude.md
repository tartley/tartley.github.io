It's summertime again, even in sodden old England, and that means it's
festival season. True to its image as one of the newer and smaller
festivals in the UK, Latitude had a good-natured crowd, diverse music -
albeit without many big-name bands, was laid-back and eclectic, and not
too muddy.

The defining highlight for me was a showing of *The Adventures of
Prince Achmed* (1926) ([IMDB](http://imdb.com/title/tt0015532/),
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Prince_Achmed)),
a beautiful rendition of tales from Arabian Nights, using stop-motion
shadow-puppetry, accompanied by a haunting live musical soundtrack by [Little
Sparta](http://www.myspace.com/littlesparta). I've wanted to see the movie for
ages - it is the oldest surviving feature-length animation, and was brought
about by the dedication of one woman, [Lotte
Reiniger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotte_Reiniger,) who single-handedly
constructed all the cutouts in the movie using nothing more than scissors, and
then animated them all by hand.
