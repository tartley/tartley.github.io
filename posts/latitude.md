[![Latitude Festival](/files/2007/07/latitude.jpg)](http://www.latitudefestival.co.uk "Latitude Festival")

It's summertime again, even in sodden old England, and that means it's
festival season. True to its image as one of the newer and smaller
festivals in the UK, Latitude had a good-natured crowd, diverse music -
albeit without many big-name bands, was laid-back and eclectic, and not
too muddy.

The defining highlight for me was a showing of *[The Adventures of
Prince Achmed](http://imdb.com/title/tt0015532/)* (1926), a beautiful
rendition of tales from Arabian Nights, using stop-motion
shadow-puppetry, accompanied by a haunting live musical soundtrack by
[Little Sparta](http://www.myspace.com/littlesparta). I've wanted to see
the movie for ages - it is the first ever feature-length animation, and
was brought about by the dedication of one woman, Lotte Reiniger, who
single-handedly constructed all the cutouts in the movie using nothing
more than scissors, and then animated them all by hand.
