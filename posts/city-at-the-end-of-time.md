*by Greg Bear, 2008*

Smashing, but not life changing. Another great ripping yarn. I find
myself with less and less patience for such a thing of late, and I'm not
sure how to tell if that's due to the quality of the works in question,
or due to a change in my own temprament.

I would, in years gone by, have listed Greg Bear as one of my favourite
science-fiction authors, but my rating for this one is slipping
dangerously close to the 'not sure it was worth my time' level. I felt
the same way about *The Algebraist*, by Ian Banks, who I previously have
also loved to death.

I guess authors have their good and bad seasons just like anyone else.
But I'm tempted to go back and flick through *Eon* and *Eternity* again,
to see if they really were as well-crafted as I remember them. Whether I
love or loathe the exercise should decide the issue.

Rating: 6.5/10 Why all the X-point-five scores recently?
