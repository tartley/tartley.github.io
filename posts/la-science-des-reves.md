*Close your eyes. Open your heart.*

I desperately wanted to like this, but simply couldn't. Told from the
perspective of Stéphane, including his dreams and imagination. The
consequent home-made surrealism was amusing for the first half hour, but
felt overused and pointless by the end. As the movie went on, Stéphane's
actions could only really be explained by filling them under the general
heading of 'having trouble interfacing with reality' - any more granular
or subtle motives were unclear to me. I feel mean saying this, because
there were endearingly whimsical touches throughout, but if there was a
point, I missed it.

Rating: 4/10.
Barmy.
