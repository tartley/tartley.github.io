*Released on Playstation 3 by thatgamecompany in 2012. Played on Windows 10 in
2022.*

The slow-paced opening scenes, alternately surfing down and trudging up
sunbaked desert dunes, failed to sustain Zander's interest, so I ended up
playing through its short runtime by myself. In some ways it's an inditement of
videogame culture that ten years later it still feels so fresh and radical to
pair players up with another internet rando, while giving them no means to
communicate or interact other than helping each other out, or walking away,
on, across the endless desert. Leading by example, and exchanging wordless
shouts seems like a pretty limited repetoire. Then, you find that standing
close enough together recharges each other's magical flying scarves. It's
enough. I don't know who the two internet randos were, with whom I shared the
first and second halves of my journey. But in those minutes together, we lived
a lifetime's worth.
