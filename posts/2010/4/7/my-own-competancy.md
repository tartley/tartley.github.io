My single degree was in Electronics and Physics, so although that
covered a considerable amount of digital electronics and CPU design,
I've pretty much picked up everything I know about software in my own
time or on the job. Consequentially, there are aspects of computer
science I feel I don't know as well as I could. I'm thinking especially
of areas which are less frequently used in practice, but often cited as
fundamental and important, such as compiler design.

I stumbled on this '[programmer competancy
matrix](http://www.indiangeek.net/wp-content/uploads/Programmer%20competency%20matrix.htm)'
the other week, and thought it would be a good first iteration of my own
syllabus of areas I'd like learn more about. So I cut'n'paste it into [a
spreadsheet](http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AmOF8t-e3EyzdE1FdW5BcDFuVURKOEZSY1NfQW5NS1E&hl=en),
and starting annotating it with how confident I feel in each different
area, along with the next steps I'll need to strengthen my knowledge in
each area.

Startlingly but perhaps unsurprisingly, the tentative next step I
arrived at in almost all areas I feel deficient was to *finish working
through
[SICP](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Electrical-Engineering/dp/0262510871)*.
Alright, alright, my path is clear.
