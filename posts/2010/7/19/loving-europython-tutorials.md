I've been loving the two days of tutorials preceding the EuroPython
conference. This morning I attended [Richard
Jones](http://www.mechanicalcat.net/richard/log)' splendid *Introduction
to Game Programming*. It was an absolute pleasure to be walked through
the creation of an example game like this, using Python game libraries
like [pyglet](http://pyglet.org/) and [Cocos](http://cocos2d.org/), by
someone who really knows what he's doing. Also, it's nice to have
something visible to show after a morning's work:

![My asteroids.](/files/2010/07/intro-to-game-programming.jpg)

(Michael your idea of making engine thrust always visible was exactly what I
needed to help me capture the screenshot.)

The code is based very heavily on samples that Richard provided and
talked us through in great detail, so although I now understand it
pretty thoroughly, I can't take much credit. Excepting, that is, for a
handful of minor tweaks I couldn't resist making along the way, like the
flickery animated engine thrust, that made me gurgle with delight.

For the artwork, I stole the shuttle icon (sssshhhhhh!), added the
engine thrust, and created the asteroids themselves entirely from
scratch in Gimp. They are just rotatable bitmaps, albeit designed in
homage of vector graphics of yore, complete with simulated CRT glow.
Brilliant!
