Hey. I notice that
[py2exe-users](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/py2exe-users)
has a recent question that seems to be about how to correctly bundle the
required Microsoft C runtime DLL with executables generated from Python
scripts.

Last month I updated the py2exe wiki tutorial to cover this issue, as
best as I was able. Since people are still asking questions about it, I
figured I'd promote that change a little.

Check out the new, revamped [py2exe tutorial
page](http://www.py2exe.org/index.cgi/Tutorial)!

That is all.
