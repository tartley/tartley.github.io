*by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, 1990*

A quick re-read, inspired by a recent visit to [the Science
Museum](http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/), where we were enthralled by
our meanderings around various astonishing artifacts:

- The rickety-looking [Apollo
  10](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_10) capsule, charred from
  re-entry, having journeyed to within 9 miles of the moon and back
  again.

- [Stevenson's
  Rocket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephenson%27s_Rocket), not, as
  I had previously understood, the first steam-powered railway
  locomotive, just a revolutionary improvement in design, capable of
  the unheard-of speed of 29 miles an hour.

- Watson and Crick's original 6-foot mechano model of the double-helix
  structure of a [DNA molecule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) (or
  at least the original bits of it, re-assembled at Kings around
  1990), constructed between LSD fuelled revelry and Sunday
  afternoons' quiet boozing pondering the meaning of life. Not a bad
  lifestyle, it has to be said.

- Charles Babbage's Difference Engine number 1, or at least remnants
  of it. This is the arithmetic precursor to his subsequent, and more
  ambitious, analytical engine, the conception of which was a precient
  stroke of genius, the world's first programmable computer. Lacking
  electronics, it was implemented in a purely mechanical manner, a 40
  year labour of which he pursued until his death.

I was surprised to learn that the failing of the device was not, as I
had previously heard, due to the inadequate manufacturing tolerances of
the time. Recent examinations have demonstrated these to be more than
adequate. Instead, the lengthy and costly extensions to the project,
leading to its eventual failure in an ocean of debts and soured
relationships is nowadays blamed on the project suffering from
'inappropriate management'. Interesting to see the nascent software
industry starting out as it was destined to continue.

It was, of course, this last item at the museum which inspired me to
pick up *The Difference Engine* paperback again, an alternate history
novel in which the authors indulge the fantasy that Babbage's project
had been a success, and the British Empire, in the upheaval of a
steam-powered information processing era, underwent a series of
meritocratous social revolutions, and as a result was better equipped to
continue its expansion across the globe.

Rating 7.5/10 - a splendid ripping yarn.
