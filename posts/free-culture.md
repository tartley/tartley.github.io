![Free Culture](/files/2008/02/free-culture.jpg)

*by Lawrence Lessig, 2004.*

Accessible, entertaining, rich with historical perspective, and cuts
incisively to the core of modern society's conflict over intellectual
property. To my mind, one of the most important books of the decade. I'd
highly recommend it. And it's available for free from your iPhone's
built-in ebooks installer, or
[as a pdf](http://www.free-culture.cc/freecontent/).

Rating: 10/10. Blimey.
