<p><a href="http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/halting-state.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-369" title="halting-state" src="http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/halting-state.jpg" alt="" width="177" height="249" /></a><strong>by Charles Stross</strong>, 2007.</p>
<p>It's a tale of corporate shenanigans, online virtual reality computer gaming, scams, police on the beat, software contractors, and political intrigue, set in the midst of a near-future Scotland. It's told in first person, by a rotating set of a half-dozen characters, which I found distracting.</p>
<p>The Scottish vernacular and the boozed-up Brit attitudes in a mildly science-fictional setting come across as parochial rather than grungy, and projected technologies such as self-driving cars and virtual realities all seem too intrusive and out of place.</p>
<p>The premise oscillates between nauseating and preposterous, as an in-game robbery of virtual items gradually tips off its investigators that&Acirc;&nbsp; someone, somewhere, has got their hands on some heavy-duty decryption keys with which far more sinister acts are being perpetrated. Before it's done, there is a scene where the software engineer caught in the middle of it all has to play a swords-and-sorcery online computer game, upon the outcome of which hangs the safety of the free world. Oh deary.</p>
<p>I really, really, <em>really</em>, loved Stross' <em>Accelerando</em>, so maybe my expectations were just set too high. Can this really be from the same author, and written a scant 12 months afterwards?</p>
<p>Rating: 3/10. Letdown.</p>
