![â€œItâ€™s gonna be
OK.â€](http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/starbuck.jpg){.alignleft
.floatleft}That's the new "reimagined" version, Dad. I don't really *do*
television, and for 2006, downloads of Battlestar was pretty much the
only exception. It's edgy and well-written, and it leaves me
breathlessly excited, and yes it had that lull on New Caprica about five
episodes in, but then it blossomed again, experimenting with one-off
shows, cool ideas, and great characters that remain emotive and
involving while staying well clear of Dawson's Creek. And what a series
finale! Blowing the whole stack of Cylon sleeper agents all at once, the
awful yawning realisation as they each heard the activation signal in
the back of their minds, all drawn to converge on the same room, what a
headfuck, with the psychedelic nebula backdrops all around, to the
rising strains of *All Along the Watchtower*, as Apollo discovers
Starbuck is still alive. Hooray! Loved it loved it loved it. 8/10.
