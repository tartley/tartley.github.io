Extensive research this week has confirmed a truth that I can no longer
contain: Try it for yourself. It is undeniable. Bananas are much easier
to open from the *other* end. Apparently monkeys all know this, unfooled
by the fallacious affordance of the fruit's beguiling stalk nubbin. Let
us rejoice in the rediscovery of this ancient knowledge, lost to
humanity for generations beyond measure.
