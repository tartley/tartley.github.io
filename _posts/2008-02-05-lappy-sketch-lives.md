  content: "@bikramjit: Hey there. You mean <a href=\"http://tartley.com/?p=51\" rel=\"\
    nofollow\">this pic</a>? Thanks for the thoughts. For the record, it isn't my\
    \ pic, some geezer drew it and I messed around with it.\r\n\r\nI don't think that\
    \ it's necessarily a picture of a God, to me it looks like a man, and the painter\
    \ titled it 'guru', which also, to me, implies it is a man.\r\n\r\nIf it were\
    \ a God, I don't think I understand how such a picture would be a bad thing. I\
    \ can't tell from your post whether you are against the pic because you are pro-religion\
    \ or anti-religion. I am atheist, plus I would like to combat religion because\
    \ I think it is the biggest evil in the world. But I think the best way to do\
    \ that is an open discussion of ideas, rather than suppression. So I think I'll\
    \ leave the picture up. Hope you're OK with that.", date: '2008-02-14 10:34:29
