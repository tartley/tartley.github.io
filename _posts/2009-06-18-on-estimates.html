<p>There is a lot of room for  miscommunication about estimates, as people have a startling  tendency to think wishfully  that the  sentence:</p>
<div>
<blockquote><p>I estimate that, if I really understand the problem, it is about 50% likely that we will be done in five weeks  (if no one bothers us during that time).</p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>really means:</p>
<div>
<blockquote><p>I promise to have it all done five weeks from now.</p></blockquote>
</div>
