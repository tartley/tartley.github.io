<p>I just can't decide how I feel about this. Part brilliant, part awful, my most bipolar experience since <a href="http://tartley.com/?p=12">Everything and More</a>. I guess I should 'fess up that I've never actually seen or read Hamlet, either, which obviously can't help. Oh deary. er... 5/10.</p>
