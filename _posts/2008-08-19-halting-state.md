Charles Stross**, 2007.

It's a tale of corporate shenanigans, online virtual reality computer
gaming, scams, police on the beat, software contractors, and political
intrigue, set in the midst of a near-future Scotland. It's told in first
person, by a rotating set of a half-dozen characters, which I found
distracting.

The Scottish vernacular and the boozed-up Brit attitudes in a mildly
science-fictional setting come across as parochial rather than grungy,
and projected technologies such as self-driving cars and virtual
realities all seem too intrusive and out of place.

The premise oscillates between nauseating and preposterous, as an
in-game robbery of virtual items gradually tips off its investigators
thatÂ  someone, somewhere, has got their hands on some heavy-duty
decryption keys with which far more sinister acts are being perpetrated.
Before it's done, there is a scene where the software engineer caught in
the middle of it all has to play a swords-and-sorcery online computer
game, upon the outcome of which hangs the safety of the free world. Oh
deary.

I really, really, *really*, loved Stross' *Accelerando*, so maybe my
expectations were just set too high. Can this really be from the same
author, and written a scant 12 months afterwards?

Rating: 3/10. Letdown.
