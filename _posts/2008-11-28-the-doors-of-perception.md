*"...draperies are living hieroglyphs that stand in some peculiarly
expressive way for the unfathomable mystery of pure being. More even
than the chair, though less perhaps than those wholly supernatural
flowers, the folds of my gray flannel trousers were charged with
'is-ness.'"*

A fairly standard trip report then, albeit one from a relatively astute
and articulate traveller. Presumably this will therefore be exactly as
fascinating or tedious as the prospect of such a thing leads you to
expect.

**Update:** I forgot to mention the amusing trivia that this is the
essay [Jim Morrison's band](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_doors)was
named after. Did everyone know this except me?

Rating 6/10 : No truer nor more deeply insightful word has ever been
written in the English language. Yawn.
