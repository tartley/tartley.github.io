![Don Cheadle in Oceanâ€™s
13](http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/oceans13.jpg){.alignleft

[imdb](http://imdb.com/title/tt0496806/)

I really, really loved 12, despite the Mockney accent. I thought the
script was just immaculate. I think I'm in a minority on that. Anyhow, I
really hated this one, with its witless Godfather references. Rubbish
all over. 3/10.
