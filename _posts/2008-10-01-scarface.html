<p><strong>Director: Brian de Palma</strong> (1983)</p>
<p>Oh, I don't know, my expectations were too high or something. I expected an intense study of greed, corruption and criminal will. Maybe I'm desensitized. All I found was that it frequently descends into simply camp 1970s gunfight scenes. Amusing to note the influences it has had on other media, particularly the mansion in <em>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</em>. I couldn't find much else to commend it.</p>
