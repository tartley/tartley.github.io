[![I am Legend](/assets/2008/02/i-am-legend.jpg)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480249/ "I am Legend")

*Directed by Francis Lawrence.*

**Summary**
This is going to be one of those reviews where someone reads the book
and then sees the movie and doesn't like it very much.

**Details**
I read *Robinson Crusoe* for the first time when I was about 30. It
forms such a prominent thread within our cultural milieu that I expected
it to be a pinnacle of literature, well-written and evocative. For me,
however, it was nothing of the sort. It seemed to have been lazily
dashed off by a nitwit aristocrat who'd never faced a single day of
hardship in his life, with no thought at all given to the physical and
psychological trials someone in Crusoe's predicament would suffer.

Only weeks later, I read Richard Matheson's novel *I am Legend*, and
unexpectedly found it to be nigh on exactly the study of loneliness and
despair that I had expected *Crusoe* would be. The portrayal of frantic
days spent repairing the fortifications, alternating with horrific
sleepless nights spent indoors, listening to *them* trying to get in, is
as dense an atmosphere of desperation as I think I've ever been party
to.

So it was with conflicting pangs of emotion that I first heard about the
movie. In many ways the movie's strength is simply the inevitable
reaction one has to the depiction of a desolate New York City. Will
Smith's character is now a world-class scientist, bent on reversing the
ravages of the zombie/vampire plague single-handed, working from his
Hollywood-style basement laboratory. The novel's pivotal ending - from
which the title is derived - is utterly transformed into something
rather jolly and upbeat. Even the signs of him fraying around the edges
under the strain have been sanitised - he talks to mannequins, rather
than drinking himself into oblivion. It's *Robinson Crusoe* all over
again.

Rating: 5/10 - not great.
