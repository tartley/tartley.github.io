  content: Very nice! Might be worth mentioning that it requires Python 2.5 (or the
    ctypes module - a requirement of Pyglet).

    is there a word yet for an innocuous-looking post placed so that the author can
    come back after it is approved and replace the contents with spam?

<p style="clear: left;"><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/06/is-it-worthy.html">Everyone</a> today is <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001134.html">abuzz</a> with the 'release early, release often' sentiment, so I've decided to get in the spirit and upload the first iteration of 'Sole Scion', my summertime sabbatical game project.</p>
<p>Version 0.1 merely bounces some circles off an inclined plane (pictured.) I aim to transform this into a 2D graphical adventure game, in which I hope emergent fun will take place, once I populate the world with enough twisty corridors, uniquely-shaped objects that need slotting into the right places, and judicious instances of ornery fauna to contend with.</p>
<p>It's written in Python, using <a href="http://wiki.slembcke.net/main/published/Chipmunk">Chipmunk</a> for rigid body Newtonian dynamics, with Python bindings using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pymunk/">Pymunk</a>. Rendering, gameloop, sounds, etc are handled by <a href="http://pyglet.org">pyglet</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/sole-scion">Sole Scion is hosted on Google Code</a>, with Subversion read-access and a source code tarball, including the redistributables for the above dependencies, should anyone be curious. It has a <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">New BSD License</a>.</p>
<p>Feedback, thoughts and ideas, very welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I've only run it on Linux, but reportedly it also works on Windows. Thanks Xtian!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> It also reportedly works under PyPy, provided you install the 'functools' module. Thanks Maciej!</p>
