Introduces Python, PyGame and game development ideas from the ground up,
in a really pleasant writing style which is both unintimidating, clear
and covers all the bases. It's definitely a book for beginners though,
walking through high-school topics like bitmaps and vectors and
matrices, but having laid the foundations, it works up to an excellent
hands-on overview of using OpenGL in the final three chapters, including
lighting, textures and fog. It makes all the topics very accessible, and
does an incredible job of putting all the various topics to work
together to form a cohesive and illustrating whole.

Nothing extremely hardcore is covered though. An 'ants chasing spiders'
state machine is probably the most involved example in here, barring the
latter parts of the OpenGL section, with four-state creatures
beautifully explained and presented. If you're already doing OpenGL or
game development, even as a piss-poor amateur like myself, you likely
already know many of the things between these covers, aside from the
PyGame specifics, which are generally transparent enough to figure out
yourself.

**Update:** In the months since I wrote this review, I've found my
thoughts returning to this book time and again, and have come to the
conclusion that I gained more from its extremely clear exposition than I
realised at the time. I'm revising the review scores significantly
upwards to reflect this.

Rating: 10/10 for beginners. 5/10 for experts. Consider yourself
somewhere between the two.
