*by Kurt Vonnegut* (1969)\
[on
amazon.co.uk](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Slaughterhouse-5-Kurt-Vonnegut/dp/0099800209).

I'm falling way behind in my avowed intention to write up all the books
and movies I'm subjected to. Primarily for my own benefit, rather than
yours, here the first of a flurry of quick annotations that I'll never
otherwise get around to. This fell off the shelf into my hands once more
upon the news of his death in April. *So it goes.*

Still touching and funny and brilliant. 8/10.
