<p>A collection of creative essays, varying from playful to unflinchingly uncomfortable, shot through with Wallace's typical humour and introspection.</p>
<p>I've tended to love and hate his <a href="http://tartley.com/?p=665">other</a> <a href="http://tartley.com/?p=12">writing</a> in equal measure, but with such ferocity that I unreservedly place him amongst my very favourite authors. There wasn't even much for me to hate in this one, relatively lacking as it is in labyrinthine footnotes.</p>
<p>A couple of the essays left me cold (<em>Tri-Stan: I Sold Sissee Nar to Ecko</em>&nbsp;springs to mind), but most of them I found thoroughly engaging and thought provoking. I'm tempted to read up on those that seemed most challenging to me (<em>Church Not Made With Hands</em>, say), and give them another try.</p>
<p>It's been a while. Rating:</p>
<p>0/10 if you don't want to delve deeply into sometimes uncomfortable subjects, such as depression, unconventional sex acts, and rape.</p>
<p>10/10 if you like to be stretched, or at least stirred around, in interesting directions.</p>
