Another great London [Python](http://www.python.org/) meetup in the
[Porterhouse](http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/36/366/Porterhouse/Covent_Garden),
courtesy of organiser [Simon
Brunning](http://www.brunningonline.net/simon/blog/). My
[Resolver](http://www.resolversystems.com/) homies Xtian, Micheal and
Andrzej were there, the latter two pulling a lappy out between beers to
quickly skip through their presentation material for
[PyCon](http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/HomePage) in Dallas tomorrow. Spent
some q.t. with Ben "mnemonic" Sanders, Elefth "crazy Greek" Stavridis,
[Menno "freshfoo" Smits](http://freshfoo.com/blog/), first-timer David
"beret" Green, and other-first-timer Rohan Deshpandethe, freshly over
from New York, bless him.
