  content: "obligatory spelling snark: competency.\r\n\r\nThat said - I really admire
    that you have the self-awareness and drive to step back and generate goals based
    on this list. I read it a while ago and kind of clocked where I fit into it, but
    it never occurred to me to try to take action on the holes it identified. I tend
    to feel too rushed/confused/distressed by my immediate concerns at any given moment
    to attain the kind of perspective you have.\r\n\r\nIf only it was easy to make
    lists while I'm running."

  content: "I'll echo everything xtian said. Very impressed. Looking at your Google
    Spreadsheet (thanks for making that available!) I've got to say I've declined
    since I left Uni!!! I really need to refresh myself on a few things if I want
    to stay in this industry (which I guess I don't have that much of a choice about
    ;)).\r\n\r\nNicely done, JB. But I'm not sure how that \"years of platform development\"
    warrants learning to program something new, though no excuse is really necessary
    for buying a Mac or an iPad now, is it?"

  content: Yes indeed, Uncle Nick - absolutely. It's embarrassing to be a purportedly
    professional programmer, but them stymied with simple operations when at the front
    of a room full of eyes just because I'm confronted with a Mac on the podium. It's
    long past time to add a Mac to my collection. And I'm mostly pro-iPad, so that
    would be cool, no doubt.

<p>My single degree was in Electronics and Physics, so although that covered a considerable amount of digital electronics and CPU design, I've pretty much picked up everything I know about software in my own time or on the job. Consequentially, there are aspects of computer science I feel I don't know as well as I could. I'm thinking especially of areas which are less frequently used in practice, but often cited as fundamental and important, such as compiler design.</p>
<p>I stumbled on this '<a href="http://www.indiangeek.net/wp-content/uploads/Programmer%20competency%20matrix.htm">programmer competancy matrix</a>' the other week, and thought it would be a good first iteration of my own syllabus of areas I'd like learn more about. So I cut'n'paste it into <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AmOF8t-e3EyzdE1FdW5BcDFuVURKOEZSY1NfQW5NS1E&amp;hl=en">a spreadsheet</a>, and starting annotating it with how confident I feel in each different area, along with the next steps I'll need to strengthen my knowledge in each area.</p>
<p>Startlingly but perhaps unsurprisingly, the tentative next step I arrived at in almost all areas I feel deficient was to <em>finish working through <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Electrical-Engineering/dp/0262510871">SICP</a></em>. Alright, alright, my path is clear.</p>
