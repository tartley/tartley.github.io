  content: "Cool!\r\n\r\nI think it's a problem that \"normal\" are illegible on Unix
    and legible on Windows, while \"dim\" and \"bright\" is legible on Unix and illegible
    on Windows.The problem is based on that you map \"dim\" to \"normal\" and \"normal\"
    to \"bright\".\r\n\r\nI think it would be better to just map dim -> normal, and
    note that there is no dim setting on Windows, so don't use it. :)"

  content: "Thanks heaps for the encouragement Juho and John.\r\n\r\nThanks also to
    Lennart. I really want to chat to people about this mapping, so your thoughts
    are very much wanted. But thus far I think we're both just a bit confused. :-)\r\n\r\nThe
    illegible settings you describe only apply when printing black text on a black
    background (top left of the grids above.) When printing white text on a black
    background (top right of grids), all is visible on both UNIX and Windows.\r\n\r\nCurrently
    my mapping is:\r\n\r\nANSI dim -> Win dim fore on dim back\r\nANSI normal -> Win
    bright fore on dim back\r\nANSI bright -> Win bright fore on bright back\r\n\r\nHowever,
    using bright backgrounds might look messy on applications that don't expect the
    background brightness to change, so I'm considering doing what you say anyway.\r\n\r\nThe
    problem is that there are two possibilities, both of which are also flawed:\r\n\r\nANSI
    dim -> (same as 'ANSI normal')\r\nANSI normal -> Win dim fore on dim back\r\nANSI
    bright -> Win bright fore on dim back\r\n(ie. no longer support 'dim', and ANSI
    normal comes out as dim text, which is probably rubbish)\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nANSI
    dim -> Win dim fore on dim back\r\nANSI normal -> Win bright fore on dim back\r\nANSI
    bright -> (same as 'ANSI normal')\r\n(ie. no longer support 'ANSI bright')\r\n\r\nI
    guess I'd choose the latter. Or maybe I could let it be configurable?"

<p>Announcing new Python package, colorama:<a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama"><br />
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama</a></p>
<p>ANSI escape character sequences have long been used to produce colored terminal text on Unix and Macs. Colorama makes this work on Windows, too. It also provides some shortcuts to help generate these ANSI sequences, and works fine in conjunction with any other ANSI sequence generation library, such as Termcolor (<a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/termcolor">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/termcolor</a>.)</p>
<p>This has the upshot of providing a simple cross-platform API for printing colored terminal text from Python, and has the happy side-effect that existing applications or libraries which use ANSI sequences to produce colored output on Linux or Macs can now also work on Windows, simply by calling <tt>colorama.init()</tt>.</p>
<p>I realise that printing colored terminal text is verging on  pathalogically superficial, but it has long irked me that this didn't  just work. Python should make this easy.</p>
<p>My mapping of ANSI conventions to the equivalent Win32 calls is far from perfect. Currently it has the following results. ANSI codes under Ubuntu on gnome-terminal:</p>
<p><a href="http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/screenshot-ubuntu-gnometerminal.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1063" title="screenshot-ubuntu-gnometerminal" src="http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/screenshot-ubuntu-gnometerminal.png" alt="" width="657" height="366" /></a></p>
<p>and the exact same ANSI codes printed on Windows under Colorama:</p>
<p><a href="http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/screenshot-winxp-console2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1064" title="screenshot-winxp-console2" src="http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/screenshot-winxp-console2.png" alt="" width="588" height="252" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>I previously wrote here about discrepancies between the two, which have since been fixed. The only outstanding issue is that colorama does not support 'dim' text on Windows - it looks just the same as 'normal' text, and as far as I know, will never be able to.</p>
