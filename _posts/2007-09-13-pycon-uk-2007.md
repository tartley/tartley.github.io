    PyConUK is in its 9th year and this year it&#8217;ll host its first Science Track
    aimed at scientists (not &#8220;data scientists&#8221; but real lab-coat-wearing
    scientists). I&#8217;m speaking in that track, yay! This track is part of the
    main conference, it all runs during September 19-21. Here&#8217;s a tiny reminder
    from the first 2007 event. [&#8230;]', date: '2015-08-01 21:58:04 -0500', date_gmt: '2015-08-01

![PyCon UK 2007 view from the
front](http://www.tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/pycon.jpg){.alignleft
.floatleft}Had a marvellous time at [PyCon UK
2007](http://pyconuk.org/index.html), a conference about the
[Python](http://python.org) programming language. In the event everyone
from [Resolver](http://resolversystems.com) bar one of our directors
went along. We met loads of great and interesting folks, heard many
excellent talks, and gave a few of our own:
[Michael](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/index.shtml) talked
about [driving Microsoft's natty new Silverlight technology using
IronPython](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/ironpython/webide/webide.html).
[Giles]{} talked about his concept of the [New Age of the Amateur]{}:
End-user Computing without Tears, and I gave a little talk about
test-driven development for beginners, which can be downloaded here:
