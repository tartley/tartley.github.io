<p><a title="I am Legend" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480249/"><img class="alignleft floatleft" style="float: left;" src="http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/i-am-legend.jpg" alt="I am Legend" /></a><strong>Directed by Francis Lawrence.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
This is going to be one of those reviews where someone reads the book and then sees the movie and doesn't like it very much.</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong><br />
I read <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> for the first time when I was about 30. It forms such a prominent thread within our cultural milieu that I expected it to be a pinnacle of literature, well-written and evocative. For me, however, it was nothing of the sort. It seemed to have been lazily dashed off by a nitwit aristocrat who'd never faced a single day of hardship in his life, with no thought at all given to the physical and psychological trials someone in Crusoe's predicament would suffer.</p>
<p>Only weeks later, I read Richard Matheson's novel <em>I am Legend</em>, and unexpectedly found it to be nigh on exactly the study of loneliness and despair that I had expected <em>Crusoe</em> would be. The portrayal of frantic days spent repairing the fortifications, alternating with horrific sleepless nights spent indoors, listening to <em>them</em> trying to get in, is as dense an atmosphere of desperation as I think I've ever been party to.</p>
<p>So it was with conflicting pangs of emotion that I first heard about the movie. In many ways the movie's strength is simply the inevitable reaction one has to the depiction of a desolate New York City. Will Smith's character is now a world-class scientist, bent on reversing the ravages of the zombie/vampire plague single-handed, working from his Hollywood-style basement laboratory. The novel's pivotal ending - from which the title is derived - is utterly transformed into something rather jolly and upbeat. Even the signs of him fraying around the edges under the strain have been sanitised - he talks to mannequins, rather than drinking himself into oblivion. It's <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> all over again.</p>
<p>Rating: 5/10 - not great.</p>
