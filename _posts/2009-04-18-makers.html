  content: "\"Right. Because, at the end of the day, you draw letters. How much did
    you *think* people were going to pay for that? It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not exactly
    adding value, is it? The foundries fucked themselves before anyone else could
    get a boot in, by choosing to base their income on idle doodles.\r\nThis may,
    of course, be incredibly ignorant and unfair of me. But so long as everyone agrees,
    that doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t matter one whit.\"\r\n\r\nJust had to personally
    let you know that you are a fucking moron for that comment above. Fonts are idle
    doodles...right. Idiot."

  content: "@argle: I'm sorry that you're hurt. It seems like we have ourselves a
    difference of opinion. How will we figure out who which one of us is the fucking
    moron? Oh! I know! We can let the market decide! So, how much *do* people pay
    for fonts these days, anyway? Oh, that's right - NOTHING AT ALL.\r\n\r\nJackass."

  content: Interesting comments that appear to have nothing to do with this post whatsoever.
    Would be interested in reading the actual post that inspired this invective...

  content: "And here it is: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2009/04/21/fuck-the-foundries\r\n\r\nHow
    these comments ended up attached to this post is one of those mysteries that isn't
    worth solving. Anyway - you're both jackasses. :-)\r\n\r\nI'm sure decent typefaces
    are a lot of effort to produce (doodling - wtf?) but if they're going to work
    with the web then they aint gonna earn money on their own."

<p><em>by Cory Doctorow</em> (not yet published.)</p>
<p><a href="http://craphound.com/">Cory</a> very kindly brought an early manuscript of this as a gift to <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/">Michael</a>, <a href="http://www.gilesthomas.com/">Giles</a> and I when we met him a while ago, and I've been wracked with guilt ever since because I apparently lost it soon after. Thankfully, it recently turned up (on <a href="http://babbageclunk.com/">Christian</a>'s desk - my fault!) last week, so I happily finished it pronto.</p>
<p>It's his best fiction yet! He must be honing his abilities with practice. \o/ Michael do you want it next?.</p>
<p>Christian doesn't like my subjectivity-proof rating system, so this one is specially for him.</p>
<p>Rating:</p>
<p>10/10 if you want a lightly styled but deeply speculative and engrossing story that winds a like a sightseeing tour around the social and personal ramifications of the ways in which modern technology is changing the way people interact, organise and get things done.</p>
<p>0/10: If you aren't interested in the ways society is changing under our feet.</p>
