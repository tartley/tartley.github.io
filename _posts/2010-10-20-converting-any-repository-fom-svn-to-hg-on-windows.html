<p>There's been a lot of <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/index.shtml">blather</a> of late about this supposedly-fiddly conversion process. Personally I've found that working on the Windows operating system, the transition is a lot smoother. Simply first install Cygwin, cd to the root of your repository, and then:</p>
<pre lang="bash">find . -name .svn -exec rm -fr {} \;
hg init
hg add .</pre>
<p>and you're done. There may be a few <em>nuances</em> this doesn't address, but come on, let's not expect miracles.</p>
