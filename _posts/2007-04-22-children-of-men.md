*No children. No future. No hope.*

A dystopian near-future Britain depicted with a realism that is both
heartbreaking and horrifying, and directed with a relentless yet
unobtrusive kinematic intensity. The human race has been infertile for
the last eighteen years. Society has lost all hope for the future, and
is tearing itself apart. The island of Great Britain presents a last,
desperate bastion of civilisation, turning fascist in a failing effort
to retain control. Militarised police line London's grimy streets, while
animated Orwellian public information displays warn that it is a
criminal offence to aid the flood of illegal refugees arriving from
mainland Europe.

The cast are incredible all round, particularly Clive Owen's tired and
reluctant hero, a powerfully understated performance that captivates for
every second of the movie. Michael Caine's aging hippy, which he based
on John Lennon, is an absolute scene-stealing delight.

it's the cinematography that is the real star, gripping and compelling
throughout, every scene lent a terrible beauty. Several minutes-long
handheld camera shots demonstrate fearsome logistical preparations
behind the camera, providing some battle scenes that are as intense,
immersive and terrifying as those from Saving Private Ryan, without
needing the gore.

Rating: 9/10\
A stunning film, compelling and emotionally harrowing, only falling
short of a magic '10' by virtue of lacking a real life-changing message.
