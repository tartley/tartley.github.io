  content: "[&#8230;] PyConUK is in its 9th year and this year it&#8217;ll host its
    first Science Track aimed at scientists (not &#8220;data scientists&#8221; but
    real lab-coat-wearing scientists). I&#8217;m speaking in that track, yay! This
    track is part of the main conference, it all runs during September 19-21. Here&#8217;s
    a tiny reminder from the first 2007 event. [&#8230;]"

<p><img class="alignleft floatleft" style="float: left;" src="http://www.tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/pycon.jpg" alt="PyCon UK 2007 view from the front" />Had a marvellous time at <a href="http://pyconuk.org/index.html">PyCon UK 2007</a>, a conference about the  <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> programming language. In the event everyone from <a href="http://resolversystems.com">Resolver</a> bar one of our directors went along. We met loads of great and interesting folks, heard many excellent talks, and gave a few of our own: <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/index.shtml">Michael</a> talked about <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/ironpython/webide/webide.html">driving Microsoft's natty new Silverlight technology using IronPython</a>. <a>Giles</a> talked about his concept of the <a>New Age of the Amateur</a>: End-user Computing without Tears, and I gave a little talk about test-driven development for beginners, which can be downloaded here:</p>
