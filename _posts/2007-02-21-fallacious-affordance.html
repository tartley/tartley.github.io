    it prevents the creation of the penguin formation during banana-consumption. \r\n\r\nAesthetic
    trumps usability yet again."

<p>Extensive research this week has confirmed a truth that I can no longer contain: Try it for yourself. It is undeniable. Bananas are much easier to open from the <i>other</i> end. Apparently monkeys all know this, unfooled by the fallacious affordance of the fruit's beguiling stalk nubbin. Let us rejoice in the rediscovery of this ancient knowledge, lost to humanity for generations beyond measure.</p>
