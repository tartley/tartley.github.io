[Rufus comments](http://howithappened.com/2007/07/pitmatic.html) on
certain English educational establishments becoming hotbeds of Northern
cultural celebration. I can't argue with the unintentional comedy of the
idea, but at the same time, such moves seem to my mind to be causes for
both celebration - long overdue acknowledgements of the richness of
human experience that shaped countless generations across vast tracts of
this land, and simultaneously a regrettable sign of protectionism,
incited by the relentless erosion of the very culture they intend to
promote.

The London Cockney may also be a thing of the past, but at least they
have been preserved in the minds of the current generation, albeit as
some kind of morbid parody. In contrast, the richness and warmth of
traditional Northern lifestyles is right on the verge of slipping away
silently, if it hasn't already entirely done so. A culture as different
from the South as another country, in everything from their food to
their industry. It may be a culture that is now almost entirely lost to
the inexorable market forces of a wealthier and more powerful neighbour,
but it is a culture that valued human traits which are sorely missed in
this harsh world.

With dialects that as recently as my grandparents' generation were
completely incomprehensible to the rest of the country, dialects that
are as close to ancient tongues as any alive today. A rich and vital
part of this country's history, political struggles, battles fought and
lost, the veritable heartland of the industrial revolution that gave
birth to the modern age - all lost, unappreciated, and almost
unremarked, save for the odd enigmatic reference to whippets and flat
caps.
