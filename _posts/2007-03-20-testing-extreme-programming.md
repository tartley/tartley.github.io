[![Testing Extreme

Lisa Crispin & Trip House.*\
2003.\
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Testing-Extreme-Programming-Lisa-Crispin/dp/0321113551/).

I grabbed this hoping that it might be the authoritative reference that
its position in the 'Xtreme Programming' series suggests, and it does
provides a descriptive overview of the testing responsibilities of both
developers and more conventional testers on an Extreme Programming
project. It touches all the bases, and even gets its hands dirty with
significant demonstration coding for *JUnit*, the venerable Java testing
framework. But beyond being a competent summary of the field, the book
seems to fall a little between two stools, and not necessarily through
any failing on the part of the authors.

If you're looking for more pragmatic guidance for test-driven
development in your own project's technical environment, then obviously
there's very little that would provide a better reward-to-investment
ratio than consulting the XUnit documentation for your own particular
language and platform, and implementing a test-driven project with it.

On the other hand, if you're looking for some more advanced topics, a
deeper exploration of the philosophies behind test-driven development,
of the nuanced differences between acceptance and unit tests, of how to
know when tests should be duplicating the semantics of your code and
when they should simply import directly from the tested code, or of the
more hare-brained ideas that test-driven development seems to lead
naturally into, such as genetic algorithms, then this book doesn't
provide it, and arguably never could have, since a lot of these things,
at the time of its writing, and arguably still, are still being thrashed
out by the development community.

In short, there was nothing in here that we aren't already doing at
[Resolver](http://resolversystems.com/). Boy am I grateful to be working
with these guys. :)

Rating:\
9/10 if you don't know how to do test-driven development.\
3/10 if you're already doing it.
