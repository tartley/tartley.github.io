    they\we most certainly do sound and act, not far off from the characterization
    in Fargo. However not in Minneapolis\St. Paul (called the Twin Cities, or for
    the people who talk like Margie, "The Cities") You just have to go to greater
    MN, get pulled over or go to the DMV something local government and you betcha
    you''ll hear a Margie or two. I had lived in the Twin cities forever and almost
    never heard people talk this way, and when I saw Fargo I thought they were being
    ridiculous. Then I got a job writing software in the law enforcement \ public
    works industry, all of the clients from greater MN sound just like that, wouldn''t
    bother me if they weren''t also brain dead.', date: '2009-01-28 03:26:09 -0600',

**Directed: The Coen Brothers, 1996.**

Some brilliant performances, some lovely moments. Emminently watchable.
Interesting point, I don't know about Fargo itself, or The Dakotas, but
the fine residents of Minnesota will insist that they neither sound or
act like the depicted characters, which is of course absolutely
charming. (love you guys! :-)
