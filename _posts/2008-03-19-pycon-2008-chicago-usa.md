![PyCon USA
2008](http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/pyconusa2008.jpg){.floatleft}

PyCon 2008 has been absolutely amazing this week. The talks I've seen
and the people I've met have been a real inspiration, and my head is
a-whirl with ideas. Above all, as always, I'm impressed by the Python
community's genuine warmth. Maybe it's just a function of Python being
relatively small compared to some other technologies, but there's
something pleasantly hippy (in a good way) about its practitioners.
[Guido](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum), for example,
unsurprisingly turns out to be eminently reasonable and affable, and the
[IronPython](http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython)
team, to whom I and Resolver owe so much, are a thoroughly pleasant and
interesting bunch.

To the people who have been asking for my humble talk slides, you can
grab them here in a couple of formats:

-   The slides as Open Office (tuned for Linux fonts, but more-or-less
    fine on Windows):\
    [TddBrooksSilverBullet.zip](http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/tddbrookssilverbullet.zip "TddBrooksSilverBullet.zip (103kb)")
    (103kb)
-   The slides as PDF (fonts 100% good for everyone, but I think the
    various animations are gone:)\
    [TddBrooksSilverBullet.pdf](http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/tddbrookssilverbullet.pdf "TddBrooksSilverBullet.pdf (162kb)")
    (162kb)
-   The accompanying source code:\
    [TddBrooksSilverBullet-src.zip](http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/tddbrookssilverbullet-src.zip "TddBrooksSilverBullet-src.zip (536kb)")
    (536kb)

If anyone has any outstanding thoughts or questions about the talk, I
always love to chat, so please feel free to email me,
tartley@tartley.com (gosh I love love love
