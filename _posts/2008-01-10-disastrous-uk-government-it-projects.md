    \ promising the client too much too soon and of a competitive revenue stream coming\

    \ cite, but you were fortunate in that you had funding and an excellent team and\
    \ an excellent and experienced lead in the great GPJT.  Focus, direction, and\
    \ a clear understanding of the engineering tools and principles that you would\
    \ use to achieve the job.  They're still only auditable to and by yourselves,\
    \ but it's in your interests to do so and you have been realistic enough to include\
    \ time and budget to do that.  Add to that the fact that you were able to plan\

    \ champagne swilling is over (which, by the way, we peons never get to indulge\
    \ in), there's not enough time to deliver what we promised.  Everything becomes\
    \ ASAP.\r\n\r\nWhy do you underbid?  Because very few people understand the true\
    \ cost of building a software system.  As a result, a bidder has to provide the\
    \ very minimal time it would take in order to appear competitive to the buyer.\
    \  But nothing works perfectly and without contingency a software project is doomed\

    \n\r\nOn the project I'm on right now it was made even worse by two factors. \
    \ The major component you and I have worked on wasn't realised as a necessity\
    \ until almost too late, so even the design and technology choices were rushed\
    \ (although I think the people responsible did a brilliant job that would stand\
    \ up to scrutiny regardless), but the employee in charge of the team of consultants\
    \ who developed it was so interested in his own profit margin which would reflect\
    \ well on him with his up-coming retirement, that we were denied the time to develop\
    \ it properly.  Even if we had been able to work more hours per week, to be fair,\
    \ there wasn't time to do it anyway.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happened over and over\
    \ again at my previous employer.  We had tremendous opportunities here in New\
    \ York to build some fantastic software, but the wrong choices were made under\
    \ pressure nearly all the time, and if anything ever got delivered it was through\
    \ the sheer hard work of the developers.  That we won the projects at all is testament\
    \ to the excellent salesmen, but there was no barrier between the salesmen and\
    \ the developers and developers are just too often too eager to please.\r\n\r\n\
    Anyway.  As a contractor, I am hired to do what I am told to do.  If that is to\
    \ tell people when they're being unreasonable, so be it.  If that is to try to\
    \ rescue a project from failure by analysing the whole situation and making recommendations\
    \ that they might find uncomfortable, so be it.  In my case, I am hired to make\
    \ sure that everyone has an answer to their questions at all times and the system\

I recently penned the following for my local
[No2ID](http://www.no2id.net/) mailing list (the Camden & Islington
branches)...

For what it's worth, I worked briefly on one of the failed Government IT
projects mentioned in the [Guardian
article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/jan/04/computing.politics?gusrc=rss&feed=networkfront)
referenced on this list a couple of days back. I just wanted to share a
brief perspective of that, in case it's useful or interesting for anyone
contemplating the possible woes of the Government's national ID card and
database projects...\
\
The consultants on projects like this have tailored their behaviour to
maximise profits in the environment they find themselves in. That is to
be expected - so long as they operate within the law they can be neither
blamed for that nor expected to change of their own accord.

The stratagems they use to maximise profits include a thorough sabotage
of project technical deliverables, such that projects appear to make
progress towards achievable goals, thus avoiding cancellation, but in
actuality will require endless rounds of deep rework and extra funding
in order to deliver a system actually does anything useful.

Every extra pound spent in this way is an extra pound billed to the
client (the Government), and every pound billed earns markups and
ongoing overheads. So for the contractors, the way to make the most
money is to drag the project on for as long possible, spending as much
money as they can along the way, without ever actually delivering
anything that works. The results of incentivising contractors this way
speak for themselves.

Of course, if such abuses were too explicit, that would give the client
a means to sue and wriggle out of contracts, jeopardising future income.
Fortunately for the contractors, the process of producing large (or even
medium-sized) IT systems is difficult and murky enough for the desired
disruption to be practically self-organising, given the correct
environment for incubation. Badly-judged technical architecture,
addiction to proprietary standards, wishy-washy technical leadership,
and good old-fashioned hiding of incompetence using imaginative
misrepresentation, these will pretty much do the job. Black-ops meetings
in smoke-filled rooms are undoubtedly only used as a last resort, and
did not, during the period of my employment, produce any requirement to
directly solicit the services of my own pay grade as a saboteur.

Presumably this state of affairs persists because Government actors are
not being held accountable for the success or otherwise of projects
under their control. If that were to change, then the Government could
possibly improve the situation by lowering the barriers to entry for
competing IT consultants and contractors, and showing some negotiating
guts to restructure the way contractors are rewarded, thus introducing
some real competition amongst technology providers to deliver something
that actually works.

That this hasn't already happened says to me that Government actors are
ensnared in some sort of corruption - by which I don't necessarily mean
an explicitly dishonest kind. The situation could charitably be
interpreted to include what I term ['passive
corruption'](http://wiki.lessig.org/index.php/Corruption) - the kind of
poorly aligned incentives or incompetence which leads to similar
outcomes as traditional corruption. (For more thoughts on how passive
corruption of this kind affects society, see the excellent writings of
[Lawrence Lessig](http://www.lessig.org/blog/).)

While it's in all our interests for this situation to get fixed in order
to improve our Government's effectiveness, I see no hope that this will
happen soon. Fortunately for No2ID this sad state of affairs provides us
with the ammunition that the ID card and database projects are unlikely
to work well, and are likely to cost significantly more than current
projections, which I agree should be exploited as has been outlined
adroitly by others, on this list and elsewhere.
