    \ been thinking about this general subject a bit since reading these posts.  I\
    \ do hope that the length of comments isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t limited because\
    \ this is a biggy.\r\n\r\nI think that politicians, in most cases, are driven\
    \ by a desire to improve the quality of life for their constituents.  The way\
    \ the political system works is that by doing that well, they ensure they&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll\
    \ get voted in again next time round, by failing to do that they ensure the other\
    \ guys get voted in. [Basically].  So I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t think they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re\
    \ necessarily by nature corrupt, dishonest or stupid, but sometimes to do one\
    \ thing well, you have to do something else badly.\r\n\r\nLet me just say first\
    \ that I agree with you 100%.  The first time I ever downloaded copyrighted material\
    \ through file-sharing was a few kids movies, can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t remember\
    \ which ones.  Anyway, I have Sky+ and these movies had been on Sky Movies and\
    \ my son had recorded them and watched them over and over.  But my Sky box was\
    \ getting full and I wanted to delete them.  So I downloaded them: I figured that\
    \ having paid for the subscription to Sky Movies and Sky+ I owned the rights to\
    \ watch them and with the exception of some possible quibbles over picture quality\
    \ (actually I think what I downloaded was if anything less good than what was\
    \ on Sky) what I had downloaded was identical. I burned them to DVD and deleted\
    \ them from my Sky box and in doing so, removed any evidence of ever having owned\
    \ the rights in the first place. So I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m a perfect example of\
    \ the innocent victim you portray in your argument.\r\n\r\nThere is a problem\
    \ here, in that the way we consume material has outgrown the legislation.  The\
    \ pain of that problem, however, is felt by two camps: people like me who don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t\
    \ like to break the law but want to clear down the Sky box (and other similar\
    \ requirements) and corporations who want individuals to buy stuff and are finding\
    \ that people are buying less stuff because they can get it for free.  Now, I\
    \ know that that last sentence (the corporations who.. bit) is like a blue touch\
    \ paper in this debate but just putting that to one side for now&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;\r\
    \n\r\nMy point is that that pain is felt by two camps and neither of them is the\
    \ government.  They have no pain, so see no great problem, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s\
    \ just something that is going on.  Now, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m prepared to be\
    \ shot down here but my theory is this: that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not the problem\
    \ they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re trying to fix with the digital britain bill.  I think\
    \ they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re trying to improve access and quality of provision\
    \ and content of all digital media for the population and create a platform for\
    \ growth of digitally delivered services whether they be for entertainment or\
    \ more mundane stuff.  ie, I think they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re trying to improve\
    \ the quality of life for their constituents.\r\n\r\nI think that the problem\
    \ that they have, the pain that the government feels, is that in order to do that\
    \ they need the buy-in of a lot of large corporations.  Now, I know that the company\
    \ putting wires under the street isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t the same as the company\
    \ owning the recording rights of artists but they have a fair few mutual thumbs\
    \ in each others pies.  And if you want to get a load of corporations on board\
    \ with your great digital Britain plan, you have to first stop them banging on\
    \ about their file-sharing problem.\r\n\r\nSo I think that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s\
    \ the problem the government is trying to fix: how to make the corporations shut\
    \ up long enough to buy into the important parts of the bill.  And I think it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s\
    \ a good way to solve it.  Like your MP said, pretty unlikely that your actual\
    \ law-abiding citizen will get cut off, an ISP surviving in a competitive marketplace\
    \ isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t going to take pleasure in cutting people off but this\
    \ means that they theoretically could get cut off and that&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll\
    \ be enough to make the corporations shut up.  Then, if you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re\
    \ lucky enough to get voted in next time round, you can start to take a look at\
    \ the much meatier and more complex and international problem of copyright reform\
    \ &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; after you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve nailed this short term\
    \ problem.\r\n\r\nI&acirc;&euro;&trade;m not saying I agree that that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s\
    \ OK, just that I see the logic in it.  I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m very against any\
    \ law being created that has the basis of &acirc;&euro;&oelig;it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s\
    \ OK because it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s us in charge and we know that we won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t\
    \ use these draconian powers&acirc;&euro;\x9D, but I see the need to do one thing\
    \ and having your arm twisted into doing something unpleasant to get there.  That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s\
    \ essentially how we ended up with soldiers in Iraq, although that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s\

---

So earlier tonight I turned up at the monthly 'surgery' of my MP, Frank
Dobson (Labour), to present my objections to the Digital Economy Bill.

For the benefit of others also going to tackle Mr Dobson on this issue,
(and anyone going to see some other MP) here's a quick write up of my
experiences:

I arrived up half an hour before it started, and there were about eight
parties ahead of me in line. My turn came half an hour after they kicked
off. I had hoped to present my argument pretty much as I laid it out in
my previous blog post. However, sadly I pretty much comprehensively
failed to get my point across.

**The 'I am not a spittle-flecked loon' introduction**

As planned, I started out by saying that I fully support copyright law,
and of the importance of finding ways to ensure that artists get
renumerated for their work. The portions of the bill which describe the
pursuit of illegal downloaders therefore have laudable and important
goals, however I think that the costs and problems associated with
preventing illegal downloads like this are substantial, and actually
make this section of the bill counter-productive. Mr Dobson was an
affable gent, and listened attentively to what I had to say.

**Disconnection needlessly punishes more innocent people than guilty
ones**

The first objection I wanted to raise, because it seems to me to be the
most clear-cut, is that the bill suggests disconnection from the
internet for persistent downloaders. I pointed out that since most
internet connections are shared between several people (families and
housemates) disconnecting a single illegal downloader would also
unfairly affect all the people who share their connection. Mr Dobson's
opinion was that it would rarely come to actual disconnection - the
intention of the Bill is very much that disconnection would be a
rarely-used last resort. The earlier provisions in the bill (warning
offenders for their first 'two strikes') are intended to stop almost
everyone from illegally downloading, without any need for actual
disconnections to take place.

Obviously I regard that as a grave misjudgement.Â  But I had a lot of
ground to cover, so I left this issue at that. I still feel that even if
disconnection were only applied to a small number of people (which seems
unlikely, from my perspective), it is still true that this would affect
more innocents than guilty parties. There is no reason not to prefer
more conventional punitive measures over disconnection.

**Impossibility of distinguishing guilt from innocence**

I moved onto my second point: When monitoring downloads, it is
impossible to distinguish between guilt and innocence. If I download a
song I own, from my home to my office, this behaviour may currently be
legally murky, but it is clearly morally justifiable. To any external
observer, this looks indistinguishable from illegal download. An
observer cannot tell whether a particular download is illegal or not
just by looking at the bits going down the wire - it requires more
context than that.Â  It requires the observer to know which CDs I have
bought, and to what use I intend to put the proceeds (is it subject to
fair use exemptions, etc?) Therefore, along with many illegal
downloaders, the system proposed in the bill will also catch many
innocent people in its net.

These innocents can appeal - there is a procedure in the bill for this -
however they will find it impossible to demonstrate their innocence. If
I have bought a CD and ripped it to my computer (which I have done with
all my CDs, many years ago) then when I am accused of illegally
downloading it, how am I supposed to demonstrate that I once bought that
CD?

Mr Dobson listened with patience and good humour to this. However, it
was clear from his responses that while he is a capable man who is
working hard and with the best of intentions, the scenario I outlined
was fairly foreign to his experience. He suggested that the bill is not
aimed at catching people like me who are doing nothing wrong. It is
aimed at people who are making a dishonest living by massive downloads
which they are somehow making money from. I don't believe that any such
people actually exist, never mind that the bill is aimed at them: The
wording of the bill clearly encompasses individuals downloading music
for their own listening pleasure, and deliberately so, but I did not go
into this.

Mr Dobson felt that the appeals process would be sufficient for anyone
such as my self to protest their innocence. I totally failed to
communicate that demonstrating my innocence during such an appeals
process would be very difficult. When I reiterated that I could not, for
example, produce the receipts to all the music and movies I have ever
bought in my entire lifetime, Mr Dobson reiterated that the bill was not
aimed at innocent people like me, it would only be applied to illegal
downloaders. I again said I don't see how the ISPs can distinguish
between the two - for example I cannot produce the receipts nor the CDs
that my music came from - I ripped them in 1998, and have since
discarded them all. Mr Dobson said that perhaps *when* the bill become
law (my emphasis), people will be obliged to keep their CDs "in a
plastic bag in the garage", in preparation for just such a scenario. I
pointed out that all of my music for the last few years has been
purchased online - so never came on any CDs to begin with.

Mr Dobson didn't seem receptive to this argument. He was still in good
spirits at this point, however, I totally failed to persuade him that
difficulty in distinguishing between guilty and innocent downloaders was
even a realistic possibility, never mind that it would actually be a
serious problem.

I had hoped to move on from this point to demonstrate that this
presumption of guilt that the bill contains will have a severe chilling
effect on people's legitimate and morally justifiable uses of the
internet, and this will hamper the development of business models, which
will be presumptively quashed before ever getting a chance.

However, Mr Dobson suggested that I should send him the remainder of my
points to him in a letter. I asked him if I could just spend 30 seconds
skipping through the executive summary of the remainder of my argument,
since I felt there was a logical chain of inferences to follow, which
demonstrated some real problems with the bill. He suggested that I write
it to him in a letter instead.

Probable ten or fifteen minutes had elapsed. We exchanged cordial
pleasantries and headed out for a lovely curry down the street with my
awesome wife.
