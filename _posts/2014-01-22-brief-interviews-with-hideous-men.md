*by David Foster Wallace (1999)*

A collection of creative essays, varying from playful to unflinchingly
uncomfortable, shot through with Wallace's typical humour and
introspection.

I've tended to love and hate his [other](/infinite-jest)
[writing](/everything-and-more) in equal measure, but with such
ferocity that I unreservedly place him amongst my very favourite
authors. There wasn't even much for me to hate in this one, relatively
lacking as it is in labyrinthine footnotes.

A couple of the essays left me cold (*Tri-Stan: I Sold Sissee Nar to
Ecko* springs to mind), but most of them I found thoroughly engaging and
thought provoking. I'm tempted to read up on those that seemed most
challenging to me (*Church Not Made With Hands*, say), and give them
another try.

It's been a while. Rating:

0/10 if you don't want to delve deeply into sometimes uncomfortable
subjects, such as depression, unconventional sex acts, and rape.

10/10 if you like to be stretched, or at least stirred around, in
interesting directions.
