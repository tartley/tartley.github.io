**Director: Andrew Stanton**

I resisted for quite a while, expecting cloying superficiality. I was
wrong. Or at least I *like* this kind of cloying superficiality. Clearly
made with love by a truly dedicated army of master artisans. Featuring
sound effects from the same guru sound guy who worked on the original
Star Wars, along with an animation team who watched every single Buster
Keaton and Charlie Chaplin movie over their lunchtimes, to inspire them
in the ways of visual story telling. With a hardcore [Larry
Niven](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Products_(Larry_Niven)#General_Products_Hull)
reference and a serious environmental message in the background to boot.
Huge fun. I watched it twice.

Rating: 8/10 - Thoroughly engaging, emotive and humorous.
