</strong></p>
<p>Smashing, but not life changing. Another great ripping yarn. I find myself with less and less patience for such a thing of late, and I'm not sure how to tell if that's due to the quality of the works in question, or due to a change in my own temprament.</p>
<p>I would, in years gone by, have listed Greg Bear as one of my favourite science-fiction authors, but my rating for this one is slipping dangerously close to the 'not sure it was worth my time' level. I felt the same way about <em>The Algebraist</em>, by Ian Banks, who I previously have also loved to death.</p>
<p>I guess authors have their good and bad seasons just like anyone else. But I'm tempted to go back and flick through <em>Eon</em> and <em>Eternity</em> again, to see if they really were as well-crafted as I remember them. Whether I love or loathe the exercise should decide the issue.</p>
<p>Rating: 6.5/10 Why all the X-point-five scores recently?</p>
