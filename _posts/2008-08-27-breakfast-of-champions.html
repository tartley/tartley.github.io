<p><strong><a href="http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/breakfast-of-champions.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-373" title="breakfast-of-champions" src="http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/breakfast-of-champions.jpg" alt="" width="314" height="475" /></a>by Kurt Vonnegut</strong>, 1973.</p>
<p>I've always loved Vonnegut (who doesn't?) but I'd avoided this since seeing the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120618/">painful 1999 movie</a> made of it, proof if ever it were needed that some books are simply unfilmable.</p>
<p>The novel, however, is everything we love about Vonnegut. His clarity, wit, grumpiness and simplicity. The story of ordinary people in a small midwestern town reads like a playful Hemmingway, but forms a therapeutic rumination on the nature of sanity, and the author's own relationship with it, in the insane world we find ourselves in.</p>
<p>Rating: 7/10 - and so on.</p>
