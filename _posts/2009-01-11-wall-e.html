<p><strong>Director: Andrew Stanton</strong></p>
<p>I resisted for quite a while, expecting cloying superficiality. I was wrong. Or at least I <em>like</em> this kind of cloying superficiality. Clearly made with love by a truly dedicated army of master artisans. Featuring sound effects from the same guru sound guy who worked on the original Star Wars, along with an animation team who watched every single Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin movie over their lunchtimes, to inspire them in the ways of visual story telling. With a hardcore <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Products_(Larry_Niven)#General_Products_Hull">Larry Niven</a> reference and a serious environmental message in the background to boot. Huge fun. I watched it twice.</p>
<p>Rating: 8/10 - Thoroughly engaging, emotive and humorous.</p>
