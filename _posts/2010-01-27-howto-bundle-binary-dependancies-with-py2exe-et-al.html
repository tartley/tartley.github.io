<p>Hey. I notice that <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/py2exe-users">py2exe-users</a> has a recent question that seems to be about how to correctly bundle the required Microsoft C runtime DLL with executables generated from Python scripts.</p>
<p>Last month I updated the py2exe wiki tutorial to cover this issue, as best as I was able. Since people are still asking questions about it, I figured I'd promote that change a little.</p>
<p>Check out the new, revamped <a href="http://www.py2exe.org/index.cgi/Tutorial">py2exe tutorial page</a>!</p>
<p>That is all.</p>
