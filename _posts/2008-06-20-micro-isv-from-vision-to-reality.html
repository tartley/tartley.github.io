  content: Bob's book is more high level than that I think. It doesn't give advice
    on HTML or C++ either. It's more a guide to help steer wannabe micro ISVs in the
    right direction. For me, the book helped me figure out what I didn't know - at
    least then I could go away and fill the gaps. I'd reccomend the book for anyone
    wanting to tread this path.

<p>Finally got around to plucking this off the shelf, and yes it's an interesting grab-bag of things to think about, and case studies of people who have taken the plunge. But there's not very much in here that's significantly unexpected. The chapter about business formalities says 'yes you should create a business plan', but has no guidance about how to go about that.</p>
<p>All in all then, a nice checklist to make sure you're not overlooking anything too obvious, but it didn't feel like the in-depth detail I was hoping for.</p>
