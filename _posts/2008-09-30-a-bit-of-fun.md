[Unnofficial meme](http://jtauber.com/blog/) from the [Unofficial Planet
Python](http://www.planetpython.org), programming languages you know or
have known:

-   **BASIC** (ZX Spectrum, BBC and GFA) Thanks Mum and Dad for buying
    the old Speccy for me and my brother, and thanks also to WHSmiths
    for replacing about twenty of them free of charge, bricked by
    wobbling peripherals. Was slow, slow, slow. Be thankful those pixels
    were so big. The foray into BBC BASIC came for a single, albeit
    paying, project at the school where my Dad was headmaster. I also
    wrote a bunch of GFA BASIC on the Atari ST, which was relatively
    cool, as these things go. Did away with line numbers, had parameters
    passable by value or reference, and compiled to produce reasonably
    fast stand-alone executables. Lacking a compelling way to aggregate
    values into structures though.
-   **Z80 assembler**, self taught on the ZX Spectrum. Wrestling with
    that darn screen's convoluted memory layout.
-   **68000 assembler**, self taught on the Atari ST. Finally fast
    enough to do wonderful things to the screen, which had a reasonably
    sane memory representation. Wished I was doing it on an Amiga
    instead though.
-   **C**, learned on-the-job at a student apprenticeship at Marconi R&D
    during my university holidays. Special mention deserved for
    Kernighan and Ritchie [*The C Programming
    Language*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language_(book)),
    as beautifully definitive and concise description of the language -
    just about every computer book employs a detracting surplus of
    verbiage in comparison.
-   **Modula-2**, as part of the aforementioned apprenticeship. My first
    OO, I guess. Full of great ideas that I didn't fully appreciate at
    the time, having never worked on large enough projects to require
    them (or indeed, any project that wasn't a personal bedroom
    project.)
-   **Pascal**, for a one-term 3D graphics project at university.
-   **C++**, on the PC, self-taught using a mixture of pirated and
    cut-price academic Visual Studio licenses. Anyhow, this then lead to
    years and years of professional C++ development, mostly on various
    UNIX boxes, mostly in the GIS industry. So exhilarating when it
    worked, with the intricate, interlocking mechanisms whirling their
    fiendishly efficient blades through tasks like a light sabre through
    butter. But writing it, with hindsight, was \*so\* \*much\*
    \*work\*. And such an utter ball ache to find those intermittent
    bugs that would shake the whole thing explosively to pieces like a
    brick through a jet engine when you least expected it. I must have
    been a masochist.
-   **BASH** shell scripts, still in daily use to this day, mostly tiny
    bits of script-fu to automate common desktop tasks, or pipe the
    output from one thing into some other thing, or heck, even to just
    do some sorting or filtering on part of the file you're editing in
    *Vi*. Absolutely indispensable to me, despite the fact that half the
    time I'm wrestling with the impedance mismatch of running it in
    Cygwin on Windows. I literally don't understand how developers can
    get along without using it \*everywhere\*.
-   **SQL** and a bunch of stored procedures in **PL-SQL** (procedural
    SQL.)
-   **C\#**. Lots to like here, we spent a couple of very happy years
    together.
-   **Visual Basic 6**, and then later some **Visual Basic .NET**. They
    made me do it.
-   **Python**, including **IronPython** (Python as a dot Net language.)
    Nirvana at last. Apart from BASH, it's the only entry on the list
    that I still use frequently and gleefully today.
-   **GLSL**, for hobbyist graphics and games.
-   **Scheme** to the extent that I worked through SICP, twice.
-   **Go**, for a new service in IBM Cloud.
-   **PHP**, to maintain an old service in IBM Cloud. Two PR's thus far.

I find my lack of **LISP** and its derivatives disturbing. And last year
I recall entertaining fantasies of learning **D**, to see if I could use
it as a more civilised alternative to C-extensions for Python. And just
yesterday I was playing with a minimal OpenGL fragment and vertex
shaders, longing to be conversant with **Cg**. Yeah yeah, I'll figure
them all out later this week...

**Update**: First time through I forgot all about SQL, PL-SQL and BASH.
