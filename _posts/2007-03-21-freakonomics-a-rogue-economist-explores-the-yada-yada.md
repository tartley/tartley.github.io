It was a bit of a phenomenon when it first came out, and I'm well known
for my curmudgeonly resistance to popular phenomena, so forgive me for
being so late to the party. I reached a point, sitting on a train
carriage surrounded by no less than *twenty-six* commuters all
obliviously reading the same book, where my resistance snapped and I
simply had to buy a copy and join them.

Bit of a let-down, though. Not so much the wisdom of crowds, more like
the lowest common denominator. There are cool ideas, here and there,
which had me chuckling with glee, but these are few and far between,
padded out monstrously, repeated almost verbatim in the introduction and
then in the main text and then a third time in the 'bonus' sections
tacked on to this revised edition. By the end I was sick of hearing
about them. Roll it all up in the sort of rhetoric that feels the need
to patiently explain that 'correlation is not causation!', and then
illustrate it with pages of examples, and you'll see why I quickly lost
patience.

Rating: 4/10.\
Would have been great had it been 1/4 the length.
