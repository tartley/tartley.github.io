<p>I use the Linux music player "Rhythmbox". This morning I wrote a plugin for it, called "Announce":</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tartley/rhythmbox-plugin-announce">https://github.com/tartley/rhythmbox-plugin-announce</a></p>
<p>Every time a new song starts to play, it announces the title using speech synthesis. I like it when I'm listening to some new music I'm not familiar with, but am away from the computer. Then I can still know which track is which.</p>
<p>If the album or artist names are different from the previous track, then it includes those in the announcement, too.</p>
