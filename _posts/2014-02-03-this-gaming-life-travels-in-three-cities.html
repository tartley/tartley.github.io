<p><em>by Jim Rossignol</em>&nbsp;(2009)</p>
<p>A gorgeous insider's look at videogaming culture, by an author who, after an unfulfilling stint as a financial journalist, has built his life around games.</p>
<p>Broken into sections corresponding with the author's experiences in London, Seoul and Reykjavik, it's thoughtful and manages to sidestep the patronising oversimplifications of mainstream media's gaming coverage.</p>
<p>From&nbsp;<em>Tetris</em> and <em>Elite</em> to <em>Okami</em> and <em>Shadow of the Collossus</em>, stopping along the way to examine the modding and indie scenes, the massively multiplayer intricacies of <em>EVE Online</em>, and the insane heights of Korean real-time strategy matches. He knows the best&nbsp;<em>Prince of</em> <em>Persia</em> was<em>&nbsp;Sands of Time</em>&nbsp;(by a country mile.) He's one of us. I felt welcomed to his world. Join us - we'll be on the sofa.</p>
<p>Rating:</p>
<p>10/10 if you understand that games have the potential to become the dominant art form of the 21st century.</p>
<p>0/10 if it's just for kids, innit?</p>
