There is a lot of room for miscommunication about estimates, as people
have a startling tendency to think wishfully that the sentence:

<div>

> I estimate that, if I really understand the problem, it is about 50%
> likely that we will be done in five weeks (if no one bothers us during
> that time).

</div>

really means:

<div>

> I promise to have it all done five weeks from now.

</div>
