  content: As a Minnesotan, they\we most certainly do sound and act, not far off from
    the characterization in Fargo. However not in Minneapolis\St. Paul (called the
    Twin Cities, or for the people who talk like Margie, "The Cities") You just have
    to go to greater MN, get pulled over or go to the DMV something local government
    and you betcha you'll hear a Margie or two. I had lived in the Twin cities forever
    and almost never heard people talk this way, and when I saw Fargo I thought they
    were being ridiculous. Then I got a job writing software in the law enforcement
    \ public works industry, all of the clients from greater MN sound just like that,
    wouldn't bother me if they weren't also brain dead.

<p><strong>Directed: The Coen Brothers, 1996.</strong></p>
<p>Some brilliant performances, some lovely moments. Emminently watchable. Interesting point, I don't know about Fargo itself, or The Dakotas, but the fine residents of Minnesota will insist that they neither sound or act like the depicted characters, which is of course absolutely charming. (love you guys! :-)</p>
