  content: "In the installer program, look under 'eBooks'.\r\n\r\nIt's possible you
    might have to install the 'community sources' package first, to see non-Apple-provided
    software (and books)\r\n\r\nIt's possible you might have to jailbreak your phone
    to do that. You're going to call me a tosser now, aren't you?"

<p><img class="alignleft floatleft" style="float: left;" src="http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/free-culture.jpg" alt="Free Culture" /><strong>by Lawrence Lessig, 2004.</strong></p>
<p>Accessible, entertaining, rich with historical perspective, and cuts incisively to the core of modern society's conflict over intellectual property. To my mind, one of the most important books of the decade. I'd highly recommend it. And it's available for free from your iPhone's built-in ebooks installer, or <a href="http://www.free-culture.cc/freecontent/">as a pdf</a>.</p>
<p>Rating: 10/10. Blimey.</p>
