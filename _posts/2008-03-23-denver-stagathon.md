![Nun of your
business](/assets/2008/03/nun-of-your-business.jpg){.floatleft}[Some
blurry photos are
up](http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/tartley/20080320Denver) of an
absolutely brilliant stag event in Denver, starting with an afternoon of
UK vs rest-of-the-world tomfoolery, which included the most laughing
I've done in ages. After a brilliant curry and singstar-style action at
Pete's ultimate downtown loft, I was presented with my outfit for the
evening (pictured.) We made a beeline for The Bank to reprise the
stalwart Colfax crawl route, where we were intercepted by *the ladies*,
and where we then, in turn, intercepted Dana Sisti's engagement party.
Finished the night roasting gently in Phil's hot-tub until the dawn.
Brilliant.

So brilliant to see everyone. Luv ya! Mean it!

Some much better photos by people with steadier hands and real cameras:

**Update:** Oh god, there's a [video of the
cowbell](http://www.aaronsdayoff.com/2008/03/jbs-bachelor-partypub-crawl.html).

**Update:** The scores are in. It was difficult to discern in the heat
of battle, but a rigourous statistical analysis reveals that team UK
absolutely dominated the laser quest:
