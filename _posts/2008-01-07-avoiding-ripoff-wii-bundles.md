![Naked
Wii](http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/wii.jpg){.alignleft
.floatleft}Over Christmas a friend was looking for somewhere with Wii's
in stock. I saw a local *Game* outlet had some, but I discovered they
only had them bundled with three or more (rubbish) games, for an extra
eighty quid over the RRP. Twice I returned, to find the same.

I object to bundling like this, which reduces consumer choice in the
games they buy, and is a flagrant rip-off, taking advantage of customers
struggling to find a Wii, which has consistently sold out ever since it
was launched.

It turns out that Nintendo object to bundling too, since it artificially
increases the Wii's asking price, undermining the console's position as
cheapest current-gen offering. Their official policy is to reduce
shipments of Wii's (read: boxes full of cash) to infringing retail
outlets.

With this in mind I discovered that, even after assuring me they had
none available, the store management and staff would then practically
fall over themselves to press an unbundled Wii into my hands for RRP, as
soon as I started asking for the store number and manager's name.

The bastards.
