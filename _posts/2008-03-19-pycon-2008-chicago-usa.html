  content: "Hi John,\r\n\r\nThanks for posting these. This is one talk I was interested
    in but wasn't able to attend. I think you should have mentioned that your notes
    are inside the OpenOffice file. I always like to read a speaker's notes, so it's
    the more attractive download for me.\r\n\r\nOh, and congrats on your recent wedding!
    I hope Mexico was nicer than Chicago after PyCon (we got more snow, naturally)."

    comments like that. I would  never write anything like this, because I would have

    remember that a man should act nice and polite, no matter if he is online or offline

<p>PyCon 2008 has been absolutely amazing this week. The talks I've seen and the people I've met have been a real inspiration, and my head is a-whirl with ideas. Above all, as always, I'm impressed by the Python community's genuine warmth. Maybe it's just a function of Python being relatively small compared to some other technologies, but there's something pleasantly hippy (in a good way) about its practitioners. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido</a>, for example, unsurprisingly turns out to be eminently reasonable and affable, and the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython">IronPython</a> team, to whom I and Resolver owe so much, are a thoroughly pleasant and interesting bunch.</p>
<p>To the people who have been asking for my humble talk slides, you can grab them here in a couple of formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>The slides as Open Office (tuned for Linux fonts, but more-or-less fine on Windows):<br />
<a title="TddBrooksSilverBullet.zip (103kb)" href="http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/tddbrookssilverbullet.zip">TddBrooksSilverBullet.zip</a> (103kb)</li>
<li>The slides as PDF (fonts 100% good for everyone, but I think the various animations are gone:)<br />
<a title="TddBrooksSilverBullet.pdf (162kb)" href="http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/tddbrookssilverbullet.pdf">TddBrooksSilverBullet.pdf</a> (162kb)</li>
<li>The accompanying source code:<br />
<a title="TddBrooksSilverBullet-src.zip (536kb)" href="http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/tddbrookssilverbullet-src.zip">TddBrooksSilverBullet-src.zip</a> (536kb)</li>
</ul>
<p>If anyone has any outstanding thoughts or questions about the talk, I always love to chat, so please feel free to email me, tartley@tartley.com (gosh I love love love <a href="http://spamarest.com">http://spamarrest.com</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> There are <a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/tartley/20080313PyCon">photos!</a></p>
