I use the Linux music player "Rhythmbox". This morning I wrote a plugin
for it, called "Announce":

<https://github.com/tartley/rhythmbox-plugin-announce>

Every time a new song starts to play, it announces the title using
speech synthesis. I like it when I'm listening to some new music I'm not
familiar with, but am away from the computer. Then I can still know
which track is which.

If the album or artist names are different from the previous track, then
it includes those in the announcement, too.
