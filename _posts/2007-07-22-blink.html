<p><img class="alignleft floatleft" style="float: left;" alt="Blink, cover" src="http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/blink.jpg" /><em>by Malcome Gladwell</em> (2005)<br />

<p>Blink is by the same guy who wrote <em>Tipping Point</em>, which I never read, and was another foolish airport buy, induced by the sheer peer pressure of it being popular. It features enough content to fill three or four fairly interesting blog posts about the under-utilised ability of the subconscious mind to come to rapid decisions which are sometimes inordinately useful but rarely trusted in our left-brain dominated society. This was then padded out to the length of an entirely unnecessary paperback. 3/10.</p>
