  content: "We wrote a tool called Terrarium to do basically this same thing: https://github.com/PolicyStat/terrarium\r\n\r\nIt
    creates a relocatable virtualenv for you and stores it on S3 or a shared file
    system. Then subsequent installs with the same requirements will just pull down
    the existing virtualenv, making it just a file copy operation (plus some path
    cleanup in some cases)."

  content: Somewhat new to Python. If you've already got the packages downloaded then
    why would you need to pip install them again?

  content: Andy &mdash; the idea is that you commit the contents of the &ldquo;packages&rdquo;
    directory to version control along with your own source code. When you check the
    project out on a new laptop, or to a new production machine, you need to re-run
    &ldquo;pip&rdquo; in that new environment to get all the dependencies to appear.
    The &ldquo;packages&rdquo; directory means that, when that moment comes, you know
    that the install will succeed without needing the network &mdash; many has been
    the unhappy developer who, with their client or boss panicked that the service
    is down and a new production machine needs to be spun up, has discovered that
    PyPI is down or that some dependency has been installing the whole time from some
    *other* web site that is for the moment down.

  content: "You can also run pip like so:\r\n\r\nPIP_DOWNLOAD_CACHE=$HOME/.pip_cache
    pip install foo\r\n\r\nWhich will create and place packages in the cache, and
    use those before downloading them again."

  content: The download cache is quite a bit more fragile than the technique demonstrated
    in the article; really it doesn't add any robustness against network failure,
    it just speeds things up (very slightly) if some of the packages are large. The
    reason is that the download cache only stores sdist tarballs indexed by URL. When
    using a download cache pip still has to use its normal PyPI+external-hosts scraping
    to figure out which sdists at which URLs to download in order to fulfill your
    requirements; only then can it check whether it has the sdists at those URLs cached
    already. So you still have most of the network dependency and latency. With the
    technique in the article you avoid _all_ network access.

    with --no-install --download!  This is so much better than before!  Good work

  content: A lot of python developers  use Virtualenv which are a way to install python
    libraries in separate, isolated containers. It's great when you need to use specific
    version of library, want to test a new library or want to install a library without
    root access or don't want to taint your whole system with it. But then you may
    need to install multiple time the sames library which is why it's nice to have
    an offline cache

  content: 'Yeah I have a lot of "-f file:///" going on with pip, its interesting
    that 1.3 no longer needs that, but with "file:///" I also had to use absolute
    paths, as the pathing arithmetic within pip was also not consistent.  Here''s
    a github issue import of the ticket where I was complaining about this use case:
    https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/111 (still open for some reason, I think its
    solved...).   If they''ve finally fixed the absolute pathing requirement then
    things are just peachy.'

  content: Hey Daniel. Everything I cite in the post as an advantage of the method
    I describe (e.g. "works even if PyPI is unreachable") is something that is wrong
    with the command you quote. (e.g. the command you show will fail if PyPI is down
    or unreachable, and hence should not be used in your production deployments. Otherwise
    you will be unable to deploy new releases or urgent fixes just because PyPI is
    down, or because some other package author (accidentally?) deleted their package,
    etc, etc. Plus it's really slow, which is a problem if you routinely re-create
    your virtualenv, for example when running tests. (which you should, for system
    / installer / deployment tests)

<p>I saw a post about <a href="http://www.scottisheyes.com/how-to-fix-slow-pip-install">speeding up the Python packaging command "pip install"</a>, by specifying more responsive mirrors for querying and downloading packages. For my situation, a better tactic is this.</p>
<p>Step one: Download all your project's dependencies into a local 'packages' dir, but don't install them yet:</p>
<p><code>mkdir packages<br />
pip install --download=packages -r requirements.txt</code></p>
<p>Step two, install from the 'packages' dir:</p>
<p><code>pip install --no-index --find-links=packages -r requirements.txt</code></p>
<p><em id="__mceDel">(The above syntax works on pip 1.3, released yesterday. Docs for older versions of pip claim to support this, but in practice, for pip 1.2, I've had to use "<code style="font-style: inherit;">--find-links=file://$PWD/packages</code>")</em></p>
<p>Step 2 works even if PyPI is unreachable. It works even if some of your dependencies are self-hosted by the authors, and that website is unreachable. It works even if the version you have pinned of one of your dependencies has been deleted by the author (some packages do this routinely after security updates.) It works even if you have no network connection at all. In short, it makes creation of your virtualenv bulletproof.</p>
<p>As a nice side effect, it runs really fast, because it isn't downloading the packages across the internet, nor is it attempting to scan a remote index to check for matching or newer versions of each package. This is much quicker than just using a Pip download cache, especially for large projects with many dependencies which only change occasionally.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://rangespan.com">Rangespan</a>, we check the 'packages' directory into source control, so that once you've checked out a project's repo, you have everything you need to deploy locally and run, even if you have no network. You might choose to treat 'packages' as ephemeral.</p>
<p>It was pointed out to me recently by <a href="https://twitter.com/jezdez">@jezdez</a>, Pip maintainer, this usage pattern has now been <a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/cookbook.html#fast-local-installs">explicitly called out in the documentation</a>, which was substantially reorganised and improved with the recent 1.3 release.</p>
