<blockquote>The iPhone vision of the mobile Internet's future omits controversy, sex, and freedom, but includes strict limits on who can know what and who can say what. It's a sterile Disney-fied walled garden surrounded by sharp-toothed lawyers. The people who create the apps serve at the landlord's pleasure and fear his anger.</p>
<p>I hate it.</p>
<p>I hate it even though the iPhone hardware and software are great, because freedom's not just another word for anything, nor is it an optional ingredient.</p>

<p>I'm increasingly aware that many of my lifestyle choices, from my Android phone and my long-standing affection for Linux, through to my choices of where I live and who I work for, are driven by my instinctive dislike for being told what I can and can't do. I value my freedom.</p>
