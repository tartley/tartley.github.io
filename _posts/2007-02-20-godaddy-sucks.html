<p>In the 36 hours since embarking upon this ill-considered plan to jump-start <i>tartley.com</i>, it has became increasingly apparent that <a href="godaddy.com">godaddy.com</a>, the cheap-as-chips host I hurriedly opted for earlier in the year, sucks <i>McSuckety</i> suck-suck.</p>
<p>Let's hope <a href="http://laughingsquid.net/">these guys</a> are somewhat better. Planned photo gallery will have to wait until I get switched over. I think I could even qualify for their 'starving artist' discount!</p>
