Me and the other Pillai's are very happy to announce that the album is
finally done. This is the culmination of what turned out to be over two
years of hard work for all of us, and despite or perhaps because of all
the barrys and the tears, in the end we're pleased as punch with the way
it has turned out. It's already all over the Internets, but if you want
to indulge us, you can buy a copy
