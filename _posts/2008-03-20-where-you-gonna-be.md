Batty](http://www.vimeo.com/user365144/l:embed_796747) on
[Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/l:embed_796747)]{.floatleft}

Peter Batty has a funky screencast of his incipient social networking
slash geolocation application, [Where You Gonna
Be?](http://whereyougonnabe.com/) which allows you to see when your
future itinerary crosses paths with other people you know. Initially
implemented as a [Facebook
app](http://apps.facebook.com/whereyougonnabe/), it now features Google
Earth integration. It's currently restricted to beta testers, but should
be opening up to all comers soon.

One day, functionality like this will be part of the ubiquitous and
unobtrusive infrastructure of society. For now, there's WYGB.
