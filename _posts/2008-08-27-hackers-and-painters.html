<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/hackers__painters2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-371" title="hackers and painters" src="http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/hackers__painters2.jpg" alt="" width="307" height="475" /></a><strong>by Paul Graham</strong>, 2004.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I'd already stumbled across many of the <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">individual essays </a>that this is comprised of, but it was still hugely entertaining and educational to discover some of Graham's essays that I hadn't read yet. He covers a wide variety of topics, and inevitably for such a collection, the components vary in quality, but generally they are extremely engaging. I only regret having to grab them in dead-tree format since I lost my iPhone. Ohdeary.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Rating: 8/10 - a brilliant read</p>
