  content: That's "picked up" as in "aquired as a new massage therapist". Thanks to
    the <a href="http://resolversystems.com/" rel="nofollow">Resolvereenies</a> for
    the Finbar-Saunders-like request for clarification, and for the ensuing discussion
    of the various types of "massage parlour" to which I might be referring.

<p>Dinner last night spent under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Whistler-painter.jpg">beady eye</a> of painter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McNeill_Whistler">James McNeill Whistler</a>, founder of the divine <a href="http://www.chelseaartsclub.com/">Chelsea Arts Club</a>, courtesy of <a href="http://nixtasinks.nixta.com/">Nicholas Furness</a> and his Mum. Entertainment provided by the redoubtable mad Greek artist Renos, gadget advice and cheap tech hand-me-downs from Greg, and a new massage therapist, Elena, picked up along the way. A highly profitable evening, methinks.</p>
