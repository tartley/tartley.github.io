<p style="clear: left;"><em>Close your eyes. Open your heart.</em></p>
<p style="clear: left;">I desperately wanted to like this, but simply couldn't. Told from the perspective of St&eacute;phane, including his dreams and imagination. The consequent home-made surrealism was amusing for the first half hour, but felt overused and pointless by the end. As the movie went on, St&eacute;phane's actions could only really be explained by filling them under the general heading of 'having trouble interfacing with reality' - any more granular or subtle motives were unclear to me. I feel mean saying this, because there were endearingly whimsical touches throughout, but if there was a point, I missed it.</p>
<p>Rating: 4/10<br />
