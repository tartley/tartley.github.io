*Tartley.com* relaunched all over an unsuspecting, with a
content-management makeover and a brand-new pseudonym **(subsequently
retracted**, at least until [Operation Cyber
Poach](http://www.whois.net/whois_new.cgi?d=gridbug&tld=com) goes into
action.**)** Fortunately for those of a sensitive disposition, there
doesn't seem to be any way to import the mouldy carcass of tartley.com
[circa
2000](http://web.archive.org/web/20010310062042/http://www.tartley.com/),
short of devoting a Sunday afternoon to the task, those being a resource
of which I am in limited supply. Luckily, I needn't be embarrassed about
having such a bare-cupboard site - as [everyone
knows](http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/archives/2007/02/020107.html), it
takes millions of dollars to create compelling content.

**Update 10/05/2007:** Operation cyber-poach aborted, the bastard
renewed.
