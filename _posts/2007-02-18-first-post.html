<p><i>Tartley.com</i> relaunched all over an unsuspecting, with a content-management makeover and a brand-new pseudonym <b>(subsequently retracted</b>, at least until <a href="http://www.whois.net/whois_new.cgi?d=gridbug&tld=com">Operation Cyber Poach</a> goes into action.<b>)</b> Fortunately for those of a sensitive disposition, there doesn't seem to be any way to import the mouldy carcass of tartley.com <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010310062042/http://www.tartley.com/">circa 2000</a>, short of devoting a Sunday afternoon to the task, those being a resource of which I am in limited supply. Luckily, I needn't be embarrassed about having such a bare-cupboard site - as <a href="http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/archives/2007/02/020107.html">everyone knows</a>, it takes millions of dollars to create compelling content.</p>
<p><b>Update 10/05/2007:</b> Operation cyber-poach aborted, the bastard renewed.</p>
