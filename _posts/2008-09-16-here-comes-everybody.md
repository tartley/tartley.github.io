*by Clay Shirky*, 2008.

Shirky has thrown a few beautiful and insightful essays over the wall
the last few months. He is the guy who penned the '[Gin, Television and
Social
Surplus](http://www.herecomeseverybody.org/2008/04/looking-for-the-mouse.html)'
piece a while back. It's a joy to find that this book is up to the same
standard.

In it, he explains how the social changes enabled by recent technology
are profoundly and permanently altering the ways in which human beings
interact, form groups, and get things done.

This is making activities and projects possible which could never have
been dreamed of even ten years ago, and is similarly displacing many
established institutions. The greatest effects of this change will be
seen when the technology has progressed to the point of invisibility,
and the current upheavals in the music and newspaper industries are just
the leading edge of the wave.

It's a change no less significant than the invention of the printing
press, in terms of its ability to transform societal institutions. We do
indeed live in interesting times.

Rating 10/10 - everyone should read it.
