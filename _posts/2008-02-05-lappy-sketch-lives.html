  content: "@bikramjit: Hey there. You mean <a href=\"http://tartley.com/?p=51\" rel=\"nofollow\">this
    pic</a>? Thanks for the thoughts. For the record, it isn't my pic, some geezer
    drew it and I messed around with it.\r\n\r\nI don't think that it's necessarily
    a picture of a God, to me it looks like a man, and the painter titled it 'guru',
    which also, to me, implies it is a man.\r\n\r\nIf it were a God, I don't think
    I understand how such a picture would be a bad thing. I can't tell from your post
    whether you are against the pic because you are pro-religion or anti-religion.
    I am atheist, plus I would like to combat religion because I think it is the biggest
    evil in the world. But I think the best way to do that is an open discussion of
    ideas, rather than suppression. So I think I'll leave the picture up. Hope you're
    OK with that."

  content: Hey Jassi. I'm not Sikh, I said that. Why, what's up? Do you object to
    me juxtaposing a picture of a man in a turban with a can of coke? No offense was
    intended, but I currently don't understand your objection. Let me know about it
    so I can better understand. Email me if you prefer. tartley @ tartley dot com.
