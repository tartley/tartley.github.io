Meme from [unnofficial planet Python:](http://www.planetpython.org/)

-   Grab the nearest book.
-   Open it to page 56.
-   Find the fifth sentence.
-   Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these
    instructions.
-   Don't dig for your favorite book, the cool book, or the intellectual
    one: pick the CLOSEST.

So here goes, are you ready for my entry? Hold on to your hats:

> This is an old birdwatchers' trick.

from *Advanced Excel for Scientific Analysis* by Robert de Levie.

This is a dumb meme. Why am I doing it then? Excellent question.

**Update:** And why did I then forget to hit \[publish\] for two weeks?
