<p><img class="alignleft floatright" style="float: left;" alt="The Hothouse" src="http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/hothouse.jpg" /><em> by Harold Pinter</em> (1958)<br />
directed by Ian Rickson,<br />
at the National Theatre's Lyttelton theatre.</p>
<p>As I was forewarned is typical of Pinter, difficult to untangle a point, but nevertheless both chilling and amusing in turns. Having said that, I'd really have to go and read all about it before I could decide whether I actually liked it or not, which I guess means that currently I don't. 4/10</p>
