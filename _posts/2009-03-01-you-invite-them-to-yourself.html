<p>Me and the other Pillai's are very happy to announce that the album is finally done. This is the culmination of what turned out to be over two years of hard work for all of us, and despite or perhaps because of all the barrys and the tears, in the end we're pleased as punch with the way it has turned out. It's already all over the Internets, but if you want to indulge us, you can buy a copy <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=2212211&amp;id=589628893">here</a>.</p>
