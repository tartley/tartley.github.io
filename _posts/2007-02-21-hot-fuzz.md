[![Internet Movie
Database](http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/imdb.png)](http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0425112/)
*Big Cops. Small Town. Moderate Violence.*

A romping lampoon of American buddy cop homoeroticism and Agatha
Christie alike, which follows the plight of over-achieving hardass
metropolitan cop (Pegg) forcably relegated to the gentile surroundings
of an idyllic village. (I particularly liked the dreaded journey to the
countryside, as represented by a close-up of the signal bars on Pegg's
phone falling to zero, but that probably says more about my own urban
snobbery than anything else.)

In keeping with its loveably teenage approach and unapologetically
English style, it provides a few golden moments which are absolutely
classic. However, one can't help but be distracted from time to time by
the fact that it has been crafted more with an endearing enthusiasm than
with incisive skill. The barrage of snap shots and hyperkinetic editing
tries just a little too hard, and by the third climax of the finale, the
whole thing has perhaps outstayed its welcome just a little.

If you like Simon Pegg (*Sean of the Dead*, *Spaced*), then this is very
much more of the same. Otherwise forgettable.

Rating: 6/10
