  content: "@Steve -- +1 to that!  \r\n\r\nA much simpler view IMO is to consider\
    \ the Git repositories as narratives, or meta-narratives, each committer being\
    \ seen as an author of one or more.  This is made particularly clear in the git\
    \ man pages, where a predominant concept is the distinction between closing and\
    \ opening -- in a sense, it promotes the use of structural deappropriation to\
    \ challenge the linear view of \"revisions\".  As Torvalds says,  \"[l]inearity\
    \ is fundamentally impossible\", so the repository -- or at least, a branch --\
    \ is interpolated into a realism that includes the \"current\" revision (tip or\
    \ head, as you prefer) as a reality.  To put it in political terms, Mercurial\
    \ deconstructs Marxist socialism, while Git analyses capitalist construction.\
    \  Bzr, of course, is a whole different kettle of fish :-)\r\n\r\nFor me at least\
    \ the underlying problem that all this is meant to solve is the object-orientiationism\
    \ that leads to the meaninglessness of version control history.  Ultimately it\
    \ leads to a dialectic, and eventually the collapse of the realism intrinsic to\
    \ (say) Mercurial, although in a more submaterial sense.  If object-orientiationism\
    \ holds, we have to choose between realism and the dialectic paradigm of expression.\
    \ But the characteristic of Git is not desublimation, but postdesublimation.\r\
    \n\r\nOf course, all this is just a long way of explaining that in Subversion\
    \ the committer is dead, whereas in Git he is simply resting.\r\n\r\nHope that\
    \ helps!", date: '2010-12-16 00:21:13 -0600', date_gmt: '2010-12-16 00:21:13 -0600',

title: A Guide to GIT using spatial analogies
wordpress_id: 1267
wordpress_url: http://tartley.com/?p=1267
---

Some developers find Git takes a little getting used to, claiming that
it is conceptually convoluted compared to other distributed version
control systems. I used to number myself amongst them.

Happily, I've found that a couple of simple spatial analogies have made
me proficient and fluent in using Git's command-line interface.

One of the things that tripped me up as a novice user was the way Git
handles **branches**. Unlike more primitive version control systems, git
repositories are not linear, they support branching, and are thus best
visualised as trees, upon the nodes of which your current commit may add
new leaf nodes. To visualise this, it's simplest to think of the state
of your repository as a point in a high-dimensional 'code-space', in
which branches are represented as n-dimensional membranes, mapping the
spatial loci of successive commits onto the projected manifold of each
cloned repository.

**Update:** There is, of course, a [fabulously insightful
commentary](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/embdf/git_complicated_of_course_not_commits_map_to/)
on reddit.

**Update:** Thanks folks. You've made my usual one or two hundred daily
visitors look kinda paltry:
