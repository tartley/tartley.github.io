Notes about some books I read, for me to reminisce over.

_Miracleman, books 1, 2 & 3_ by Alan Moore, Alan Davies, & John Totleben.

I spent a little time digging out earlier works of Alan Moore. These
inter-library loans didn't disappoint.

Originally published as _Marvelman_ by Mick Anglo, from
1954-59. Legal battles rebranded the character as _Miracleman_ in 1985.

The opening pages reprint one of those campy early stories, involving
primary-colored moralizing while flying around to punch time-travelling nazi
super-scientists.

They then continue with Alan Moore's postmodern 1980's reboot. This recasts the
simplistic tales of the original period as a placating dream, fed to a captured
Miracleman by his nemesis. His hokey origins story is similarly reploughed. The
ensuing tales are dark and introspective.

One thread follows the emotional stresses placed on Miracleman when incarnated
as his human alter-ego, the frail and fallible half of a godlike being. He's
unable to concieve a child with his wife, although _Miracleman_ can, and
succumbs to self-loathing and jealousy, culminating in a touching scene in
which he climbs a mountain, leaves a folorn monument, and changes into
Miracleman one last time, never to change back.

Yes, this is more uneven than Moore's later works. Yes, it's unashamedly an
underwear-on-the-outside superhero story. But nonetheless I loved it, and
scenes like the above have stayed with me for months.

_Swamp Thing, Vol 1: Saga of the Swamp Thing_ by Alan Moore, John Totleben, & Steve Bissette.

Moore's deconstruction of existing characters continues. Originally Swamp
Thing was Alec Holland, miraculously transformed by in infusion of
artificially stimulated plant matter. When Alan Moore takes over the writing,
Swamp Thing's ostracisation and existential dread is compounded by the
discovery that this origins story has been a delusion all along. Alec Holland
was killed outright in the accident, and an accumulation of plant matter grew
around his decaying form, integrating the physical remains of his memories
into a creature that yearned to recapture its human form, but was never human
in the first place.

_Hull Zero Three_ by Greg Bear.

A smashing hard SF tale, about the existential mystery of life aboard a
generation starship that has lost its way. Following in the footsteps of
classic variations, such as _Non-Stop_, _Methusalah's Children_, and _Tau
Zero_, it centers around the character's revalations as they uncover their
situation and origins, being decanted to order by warring factions amongst
high technology ruins.

_Station Eleven_ by Emily St. John Mendel.

An evocative tale of intertwined lives, before and after the sudden fall of
contemporary civilisation due to a global pandemic.

<br style="clear: both" />

_The Atrocity Archive_ by Charles Stross. The conceit of Lovecraftian horror
rationalized to a mathematical or computable topic is appealing to me, and
kept the pages turning, but I didn't ultimately find it life-changing.

_Nightwings_ by Robert Silverberg. A fantastical far-future tale of humanity
split into occupational castes, guarding the world against prophesied
invasion. Not my thing.
