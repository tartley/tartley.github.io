It's summertime again, even in sodden old England, and that means it's
festival season. True to its image as one of the newer and smaller
festivals in the UK, Latitude had a good-natured crowd, diverse music -
albeit without many big-name bands, was laid-back and eclectic, and not
too muddy.

The defining highlight for me was a showing of *[The Adventures of
Prince Achmed](http://imdb.com/title/tt0015532/)* (1926), a beautiful
rendition of tales from Arabian Nights, using stop-motion
shadow-puppetry, accompanied by a haunting live musical soundtrack by
[Little Sparta](http://www.myspace.com/littlesparta). I've wanted to see
the movie for ages - it is the first ever feature-length animation, and
was brought about by the dedication of one woman, Lotte Reiniger, who
single-handedly constructed all the cutouts in the movie using nothing
more than scissors, and then animated them all by hand.
