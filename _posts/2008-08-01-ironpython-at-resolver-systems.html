  content: "[...] Jonathan Hartley, a developer here at Resolver Systems, has contributed
    to the set of Python Success Stories at Pythonology.org with a description of
    how we&#8217;ve benefited from using Python - and in particular IronPython.&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;
    It&#8217;s well worth a read, especially if you&#8217;re interested in how we

It's up on Pythonology.org's "Python success Stories" section, and will also propagate to wingware.com and python.org.</p>
