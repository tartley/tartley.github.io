  content: But! But! You linked to someone's 'make your own' page, so I did. You practically
    *made* me. I'm not to blame. It was your fault! YOU did it! You did it to your
    self. Autoplagiarist!

  content: But!  But!  I'll hold my breath until you update your article to reference
    mine then, so that I can get all the hits I deserve for manipulating your actions
    so cleverly.  Either that, or the whole web will fall to pieces.

  content: OMG what an online gaffe! Rectified immediat<i>ment</i>, but how do I link
    to your particular post? And, come to that, when I saw an interesting comment
    the other day, on your brilliant 'recent comments' doobrie, I was unable to trace
    it back to the post to which it refers. Am I dumb? Don't answer that.

<p>The old tartley.com used to have one of these, so here's a quickie replacement. It tends to overstate the case somewhat, a single foray across a border floods entire countries. I'd imagine good old Google's freebie geospatial tools could be put to use to create a better one, but for the time being, here's an amusing approximation. I'd be amused to see Skankmeister's version.</p>
