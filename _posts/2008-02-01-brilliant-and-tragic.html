  content: "These people are the idiots.  They are winning.  They do what they are
    told.  Soon you will stick out like a sore thumb for complaining.  They are not
    being brainwashed - they do not have brains.\r\n\r\nThe solution, which I've learnt
    the hard way, is to tell them that you must speak to their supervisor.  Don't
    ask, they don't do what they're asked.  Tell them.  They do what they're told.\r\n\r\nKeep
    your head down and your chin up..."

  content: "Yay! When I call O2, and try to interact with them, they ask me what the
    answer to my security question is. You know, when you set up an account, and they
    let you select one of a set of security questions, and give them your answer to
    that question. All well and good.\r\n\r\nNow when I talk to the CSR at O2, they
    tell me that the security policy has changed, and they are not allowed to ask
    me the security question. I just have to tell them what the answer is.\r\n\r\nIt
    makes me feel like Josef K.\r\n\r\nI understand why they changed the policy. But
    there are obviously correct solutions to the problem, and this is not one of them."

<p>Susan was on the phone to the phone company the other day. She couldn't verify her identity as the account holder, because the phone service in question was actually bought by me, as a gift. Because of this, the CSR declined to give her any information, not even publically available stuff like their customer service phone number. When gently quizzed about the rationale behind that, the CSR responded with a newspeak-laden pitch about the heightened-security society in which we live. It was like that moment in Fight Club, when Norton suddenly realises "Ah! I geddit! You're a <i>moron</i>."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our society consists of CSRs like this. They are <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/quotes">the people we depend on</a>. They cook our meals, they haul our trash, they connect our calls, they drive our ambulances. They guard us while we sleep.</p>
<p>And they are being <i>brainwashed</i> by the current climate of terrorist hysteria, Kafka-esque security checks, idiotic travel restrictions, the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080131-tsa-blog-smackdown-explain-to-me-about-bomb-juice.html">TSA's Constitution-free zone</a>, into believing that a security state (and an <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/01/tsa_misses_the.html">ineffectual one</a>, at that) is a good and desirable thing. It just makes me want to break down and weep and go and live on an island somewhere.</p>
<p>And then - my ray of hope - every so often you find things like this...</p>
