  content: "I spent years struggling with the current notation, but most people seem\
    \ to manage it.  However, that's not a real argument and certainly not the one\
    \ I'll use here...\r\n\r\nWhile I like the idea of some of the above, there are\
    \ clear reasons why they hadn't been adopted before and are only relevant in a\
    \ technology-based system where machines can print the music out.  Many of them\
    \ are susceptible to accuracy of drawing (spread of ink, late-nightedness of writing,\
    \ level of inebriation) that would not be the case with the current system.\r\n\
    \r\nTo me, using the shape to indicate pitch seems to me as arbitrarily bonkers\
    \ as the sharp or flat symbol (which, btw, seems to work rather well, although\
    \ the underlying framework of octave-offsets is a bit nuts, it has to be said).\r\
    \n\r\nAnd if by \"color\" you mean anything more than \"fill\", slappety slap.\r\
    \n\r\nI love the idea of just two lines and everything else annotated appropriately,\
    \ although there is still redundancy between A# and B.  Why should the B be higher?\
    \  It's got the line.  Or why should it have the line, since it's higher?  But\
    \ I am still a little concerned that without the fill-distinction (a pain the\
    \ arse, I'm sure, when writing by hand)that it would be all to easy to confuse\
    \ F with F# and G with F#.\r\n\r\nAnd why have F# and G flat?  Why not just F#?\
    \  I assume that's also a suggestion, although it isn't reflected above.\r\n\r\
    \nOh, it's all shit.  I can hardly read English as it is, how am I ever going\
    \ to master music.\r\n\r\nAre they also suggesting different notations for different\
    \ instruments?  They're probably already busy setting up a cartel of translation\
    \ services providers and re-education seminars.  And does the whole world subscribe\
    \ to the current system?  Or Koreans different, the Japanese, the Chileans or\
    \ Africans?\r\n\r\nI can't be arsed any more...  And there's no running water...",

  content: 'A comparison occurs to me which I think makes the importance of this fairly
    clear. The notation used by the Roman Empire to write numbers must have seemed
    perfectly adequate to those who used it. There are convoluted methods available
    for performing arithmetic with Roman numerals - it did its job, and the fact there
    were some operations that couldn''t be performed were doubtless written off by
    those attempting them due to the plain fact that numbers were <i>hard</i>. But
    in actual fact, numbers aren''t hard. They were just using a suboptimal notation.
    By failing to tune the notation to make these arithmetic operations fluid and
    seamless, they were held back to pre-Greek levels of maths and science for nigh
    on a thousand years. Notation <i>matters</i>. It shapes our conceptions of a topic,
    and moulds our ability to think. Getting the notation as right as we can possibly
    get it is a vital foundation in allowing the creativity of current and future
    generations to blossom. So there.', date: '2007-06-11 14:04:55 -0500', date_gmt: '2007-06-11

It's been said before by others, but I hadn't realised how insidious it
is: When musicians talk about 'theory', they actually mean 'notation'.
With reference to my [previous whinging](http://tartley.com/?p=100)
about music notation, I notice that the [Music Notation Modernization
Association](http://www.mnma.org/) are suggesting a number of revisions
to make notation more useful and consistent. One of the more prominent
suggestions is a change to the use of staves to make them compatible
with the octave-offset principle I mentioned earlier, thus making the
appearance of notes consistent across all staves, and making the use of
clefs of any kind redundant.

The above idea especially comes into its own when combined with their
other proposals:

-   *Chromatic staves* to indicate intervals in a proportional manner
    (rather than the current bonkers '♯' and '♭' notation)\
    ![chromatic-intervals.gif](http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/chromatic-intervals.gif)
-   *Twinline* staves, which only require two horizontal lines, rather
    than the conventional five, provides a significant increase in
    readability, in keeping with Tufte's principle of [maximising
    data-ink
    ratio](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142/).\
    ![twinline.gif](http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/twinline.gif)
-   *Note color* or shape used to discriminate pitch, rather than the
    current quirky use of partially indicating note length. This is
    perhaps my favourite, as it massively increases the ease of rapidly
    identifying notes on sight. Since note colour is currently used to
    distinguish between a minim and a crotchet, then some other way of
    making them distinct would have to be found. A unique flag on the
    note stem would seem to suffice, and would be more in keeping with
    the other note duration symbology.\
    ![note-color.gif](http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/note-color.gif)

After what looks like years of painstaking brainstorming, research,
focus testing and refinement, the only thing left for the MNMA to do is
to decide on one single notation that unambiguously combines all the
above ideas, and promote its use with the aim of gradually supplanting
conventional notation. Unfortunately, this seems to be something they
have singularly failed to do. By failing to adopt and recommend a single
notation, they seem to be ensuring that none of their ideas will ever
gain any traction.
