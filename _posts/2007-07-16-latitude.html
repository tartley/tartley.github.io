<p>It's summertime again, even in sodden old England, and that means it's festival season. True to its image as one of the newer and smaller festivals in the UK, Latitude had a good-natured crowd, diverse music - albeit without many big-name bands, was laid-back and eclectic, and not too muddy.</p>
<div class="floatright"><a title="Prince Achmed" href="http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/prince-achmed.jpg"><img class="alignnone" alt="Prince Achmed" src="http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/prince-achmed.jpg" width="405" height="286" /></a></div>
<p>The defining highlight for me was a showing of <em><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0015532/">The Adventures of Prince Achmed</a></em> (1926), a beautiful rendition of tales from Arabian Nights, using stop-motion shadow-puppetry, accompanied by a haunting live musical soundtrack by <a href="http://www.myspace.com/littlesparta">Little Sparta</a>. I've wanted to see the movie for ages - it is the first ever feature-length animation, and was brought about by the dedication of one woman, Lotte Reiniger, who single-handedly constructed all the cutouts in the movie using nothing more than scissors, and then animated them all by hand.</p>
