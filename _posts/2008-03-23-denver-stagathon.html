<p><img class="floatleft" src='http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/nun-of-your-business.jpg' alt='Nun of your business' /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/tartley/20080320Denver">Some blurry photos are up</a> of an absolutely brilliant stag event in Denver, starting with an afternoon of UK vs rest-of-the-world tomfoolery, which included the most laughing I've done in ages. After a brilliant curry and singstar-style action at Pete's ultimate downtown loft, I was presented with my outfit for the evening (pictured.) We made a beeline for The Bank to reprise the stalwart Colfax crawl route, where we were intercepted by <i>the ladies</i>, and where we then, in turn, intercepted Dana Sisti's engagement party. Finished the night roasting gently in Phil's hot-tub until the dawn. Brilliant.</p>
<p>So brilliant to see everyone. Luv ya! Mean it!</p>
<p>Some much better photos by people with steadier hands and real cameras:</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> The scores are in. It was difficult to discern in the heat of battle, but a rigourous statistical analysis reveals that team UK absolutely dominated the laser quest:</p>
