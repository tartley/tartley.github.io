  content: "Hey hey!\r\n\r\nI toyed with the ReadyNAS but ended up getting a Terastation.
    However, that was back when there were only a couple of options. I made the wrong
    decision then, but I don't know what the right one is now. It's wrong, by the
    way, because the write speeds to my Terastation are totally hosed - bad RAID chipset.
    Read is plenty good for 720 tho.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I'm very very happy with my new
    setup, which is Plex (brilliant Mac OS branch of XBMC) on a Mac Mini with loadsaUSB
    drives in the Mac Mini and the Terastation across Gigabit ethernet.\r\n\r\nHoorah
    for home media center setups! Now, how long will it be before you can stream my
    movies to your screen?!?!"

  content: Moores law for storage suggests that maybe we won't need to stream your
    movies to my screen - we'll all simply have hard drives big enough for every movie
    ever made. :-)

<p>I just bought a <a href="http://www.dabs.com/products/netgear-readynas-duo--2-bay----no-drives-included-5063.html">NetGear ReadyNas Duo</a> to connect hard drives to my home network, to stream movies and the like to our fabulous Xbox Classic media center. In the process of researching, I was wondering whether the kind of hard drive connection matters. I mean, if you plug USB hard drives into a device like that, does it run fast enough to stream one or more movies simultaneously? How many simultaneous movies or audio streams would your average home ethernet carry? My first stab at answering these questions are below.</p>
<p>On the left are various network and hard drive connection technologies. On the right are various uses to which I might want to put them. You can't use a slower connection (eg. bluetooth) to drive a faster usage (eg. blu-ray quality movies). Centre column is the data rate in megabits per second (Mb/s):</p>

<p>I'm assuming that I don't have gigabit ethernet, because I've never paid it any attention in the past. Judging from the above, my 100BaseT should be more than adequate, but will be the weakest link. So that'll be the first thing I look at if streaming seems sub-par. Coolio!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Everything works swimmingly. I've had no problem with streaming speeds. Problems *have* occurred with some .avi files which appeared to have invalid interleave cross-stream differential parity (or something) and efforts to reverse their polarity were to no avail (transcoding software generally wouldn't even read the files!) A quick visit or two to MiniNova fixed all that.</p>
