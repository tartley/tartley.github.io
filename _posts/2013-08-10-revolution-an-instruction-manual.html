<p>When you have a government that operates without limits, who proclaims the right to arrest, torture and kill anyone, anywhere, with no warrants, no trial, no due process...</p>
<p>When you have a government that militarizes the police and grants the armed forces the power to operate with impunity within your own borders and beyond. A government that views you, the people, as the enemy, and treats you as such...</p>
<p>When you have a government that lies to you takes you into wars of aggression, toppling country after country, killing hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians, and sending your sons and daughters and your fathers and your brothers home in flag draped coffins, or disfigured and broken in mind and body, their lives destroyed in wars that serve only to line the pockets of a unelected cartel of bankers and corporations...</p>
<p>When you have all of this right in front of you, so blatant, so clear, you shouldn't have to be convinced that both parties in this political puppet show are owned and operated by the same interests. You shouldn't have to be convinced that these overrated corporate popularity contests that some call elections are distractions that will achieve nothing. With this understood, you shouldn't have to be convinced that the system you are living under must be brought to a halt.</p>
