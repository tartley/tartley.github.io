  content: Downward-pointing stems go on the left-hand side of the note. Thanks. :-)
    So the stems of simultaneous notes don't line up - high-pitched notes appear to
    be staggered slightly behind low-pitched notes. Add it to the list.

<p>Writing music out by hand is incredibly laborious. Or at least, it is for me. This is my first attempt to pen some notes by plonking around on the keyboard until it sounds right. Doubtless errors of all kinds abound, which I'd be much obliged if anyone pointed out to me, tar very much.</p>
