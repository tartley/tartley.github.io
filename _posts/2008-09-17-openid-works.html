  content: "Don't the comments in the article you link to (Ned Batchelder's rant)
    seem to indicate that this is both insecure and inconvenient?\r\n\r\nI don't know
    exactly how it works (it bemused me when I once tried, for the same reasons it
    bemused Ned, although he persisted once I'd already given up) but one thing that
    jumps out is that it relies on DNS which isn't exactly the most secure or unspoofable
    thing around.\r\n\r\nMe so unconwinced!"

  content: "Hey Nick,\r\n\r\nAll you say has elements of truth in it. OpenID is certainly
    a pain to set up initially, as both Ned, yourself and I found.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    once in place I've found it convenient to use, no less so than signing up for
    new accounts at websites anyhow, especially if they ask for more info than just
    'username/desiredpassword/confirmpassword'\r\n\r\nRegarding the security, it's
    certainly possible to use it in an insecure manner. This is generally the case
    with many aspects of security, not just OpenID-related stuff. It is possible to
    guard against the sort of problems you mention using a handful of mechanisms:\r\n\r\n1)
    make sure you choose an openID provider who offers browser side SSL certificates
    instead of just username/password logons.\r\n2) make sure you choose an openID
    provider who publishes a security certificate revocation list, and enable the
    use of such lists on your brower\r\n3) use the methods your openID provider gives
    to let you verify that they are really them, not a phishing attack instigated
    by polluted DNS, eg. mine displays an image that I chose and saved in a cookie.
    Nobody other sites have access to that cookie, so if I don't see the image, then
    I know something's up. Obviously I have to set this cookie on every computer I
    use.\r\n\r\nOne of the strengths of openID is that I don't have to choose one
    central provider and cross my fingers that them implement all of the above : there
    are many openID providers and one of the axes upon which they compete is in the
    security features they offer. Eventually, once we've figured all this out, presumably
    they will all provide things like this as standard, and will gradually figure
    out a way to make the initial setup more convenient. This is my hope, anyway.
    I don't see any more viable solutions to this problem, so I'm happy to run with
    OpenID until anything better comes along.\r\n\r\nBut basically I was afraid that
    if I signed up too late, then all the good usernames would be gone.\r\n"

<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-387" title="openid" src="http://www.tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/openid.jpeg" alt="" width="107" height="105" />I've always been intrigued by <a href="http://openid.net">OpenID</a>, while simultaneously being repulsed by the identifiers that I thought users were forced to adopt. Seeing one too many strings like:</p>
<blockquote><p>https://me.yahoo.com/a/.DuSz_IEq5Vw5NZLAHUFHWEKLSfQnRFuebro-</p></blockquote>
<p>tossed around made me think I'd have to adopt a username like that, which obviously is never going to wash, for aesthetic and typability reasons alone.</p>
<p>Fortunately <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200809/openid_is_too_hard.html">Ned Batchelder's rant</a>, leading me to <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2006/Dec/19/openid/">Simon 'Zeppelin' Willison's demystifying blog post</a>, taught me all about how to use your own URL as your OpenID equivalent of a username, by inserting some HTML onto your web page. So now I've managed to jump through the sign-up hoops required to get me one of those globally-unique OpenID username identifiers for myself:</p>
<blockquote><p>tartley.com</p></blockquote>
<p>There. That isn't too painful, is it? Since I got set up, it has proven lovely to use. Get on board!</p>
