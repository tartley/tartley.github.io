<p>So I'm helping a friend create a small website. Casting around for lightweight tools, I remember that <a href='http://joelonsoftware.com/'>an intelligent and influential blogger</a>, much admired by me, has founded a software company which produces, amongst other things, <a href='http://www.fogcreek.com/CityDesk/'>City Desk, a web site creation tool</a>.</p>
<p>Checking out their website, I am delighted to find there is a free-to-use version for small projects much like the one I am embarking on. I download it, install it, and fire it up eagerly. Just about the last thing I expected to see was this.<br />

<p>Just goes to show, creating software which <i>just works</i> is a tough problem. If the likes of Joel can't figure it out, what hope do the rest of us have...?</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> It looks like the problems are due to my Windows user account being limited privs. I perform installs and the like with elevated privs, using the brilliant <a href='http://blogs.msdn.com/aaron_margosis/archive/2004/07/24/193721.aspx'>MakeMeAdmin.cmd</a>. It looks like running CityDesk for the first time performs some install-related activities, such as setting up the Platform SDK, which require admin privs. Once this is done, subsequent runs can be done as a limited privs user with no problems.</p>
