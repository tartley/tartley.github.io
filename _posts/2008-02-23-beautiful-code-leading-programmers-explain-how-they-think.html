  content: God I was grumpy when I wrote the above. I've been re-reading Beautiful
    Code recently and it's a stonking good read.

<p>I was wondering how to explain why I didn't like this book as much as I thought I would - possibly as much as I thought I <em>ought</em> to. Thirty-odd genius bitwranglers delving into their favourite bits of code - surely it must be <em>packed</em> with fabulous insights into the zen of programming. But something about it left me flat, and I was having trouble putting my finger on why. Fortunately Jeff Atwood's ever brilliant <em>Coding Horror</em> has saved me the bother, by <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001062.html">explaining it perfectly</a>.</p>
<p>Programmers love code. It is the culmination of their labours. It's not just a document or a diagram, but is a dynamic, living record of their conceptual jujutso. But to focus on the code itself, in a variety of languages, which few readers are likely to be familiar with all of, is a relatively superficial theme, and comes at the expense of the abstract designs that the code embodies, and of the features and capabilities of the languages themselves.</p>
<p>Rating 6/10: Contains some gems, but generally falls between two stools.</p>
