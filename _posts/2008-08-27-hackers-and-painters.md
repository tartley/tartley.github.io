Paul Graham**, 2004.**\
**

I'd already stumbled across many of the [individual
essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html)that this is comprised
of, but it was still hugely entertaining and educational to discover
some of Graham's essays that I hadn't read yet. He covers a wide variety
of topics, and inevitably for such a collection, the components vary in
quality, but generally they are extremely engaging. I only regret having
to grab them in dead-tree format since I lost my iPhone. Ohdeary.

Rating: 8/10 - a brilliant read
