  content: I would give it slightly higher marks as the subject matter was not so
    common, from my perspective.  Of course, I am American and the mundane in your
    world may seem exotic in mine.  My biggest disappointment was that they ran out
    of prints in the gift shop!  Do you have any idea where I can order a copy of
    the above print?

  content: Hey Daniel, thanks for that - that seems reasonable. And no doubt what
    you say about exotica works visa-versa too. I don't know where to get prints,
    though!

<p><img class="alignleft floatleft" style="float: left;" src="http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/pppsophia.jpg" alt="Sophia" />A special highlight, as is so often the case, is the image featured in the exhibition's promotions, <em>Sophia</em> (left), by Billy &amp; Hells, one in a series of photographs that emulates the type of lighting effects favoured by Dutch golden age painters.</p>
<p>Other than that though, the exhibition left me somewhat flat, consisting pretty much exclusively of the usual crop of east-European peasants; sullen, pubescent girls in various states of undress; and of course Sir Ian Mckellen. I guess it's inevitable, but it's a shame to turn up to an exhibit, especially one as small as this, only to find that you've already seen the best bits on the posters on the tube.</p>
<p>Rating: 4/10 - the prints on the tube were bigger, too!</p>
