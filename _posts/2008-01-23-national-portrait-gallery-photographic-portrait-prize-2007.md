    would give it slightly higher marks as the subject matter was not so common, from
    my perspective.  Of course, I am American and the mundane in your world may seem
    exotic in mine.  My biggest disappointment was that they ran out of prints in
    the gift shop!  Do you have any idea where I can order a copy of the above print?',

![Sophia](/assets/2008/01/pppsophia.jpg){.alignleft
.floatleft}A special highlight, as is so often the case, is the image
featured in the exhibition's promotions, *Sophia* (left), by Billy &
Hells, one in a series of photographs that emulates the type of lighting
effects favoured by Dutch golden age painters.

Other than that though, the exhibition left me somewhat flat, consisting
pretty much exclusively of the usual crop of east-European peasants;
sullen, pubescent girls in various states of undress; and of course Sir
Ian Mckellen. I guess it's inevitable, but it's a shame to turn up to an
exhibit, especially one as small as this, only to find that you've
already seen the best bits on the posters on the tube.

Rating: 4/10 - the prints on the tube were bigger, too!
