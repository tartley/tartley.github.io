Hey. I'm doing some Perl coding on the side. Who knows a good way to interleave two lists? For example, combining (1, 3 ,5) and (2, 4, 6) to produce ((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)) ?
</div>
<div style="background: #eed; padding:1em;">
It's easy, Perl has a built-in zip operator:</p>
<blockquote><p>
my @result = (1, 3 ,5) &#x00A5; (2, 4, 6)
</p></blockquote>
</div>
<div style="background: #fff; padding:1em;">
Brilliant, thanks. Hang on. What the crap!? Is that really a <i>Yen</i> symbol in there? You have got to be shitting me. What. The. Crap.
</div>
<div style="background: #eed; padding:1em;">
Ha! Yeah, I know, its a little weird, but since Perl supports source code unicode encodings, we thought "why not?" Typographically, it looks like a little zipper, you see? Geddit?
</div>
<div style="background: #fff; padding:1em;">
Right. I see that now. Um. So which unicode Yen symbol do I use?</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#x00A5; U+00A5 YEN SIGN<br />
&#xFFE5; U+FFE5 FULLWIDTH YEN SIGN
</p></blockquote>
<p>They both look the same in my browser. In fact, they both just look like question-marks in many people's browsers.
</p></div>
<div style="background: #eed; padding:1em;">
Oh, you can easily tell the difference - one of them simply won't work. Just try them both out until you find the one that works!!!!  :-)
</div>
<div style="background: #fff; padding:1em;">
Right. Brilliant. And who is responsible for this gem?
</div>
<div style="background: #eed; padding:1em;">
Oh, that was Larry. Look, if you don't like it, come to think of it, it's been renamed recently. The zip operator is now simply spelt 'Z'.
</div>
<div style="background: #fff; padding:1em;">
Yeah, whoever would have predicted that might happen? Guess who gets their language designer privileges revoked? Morons. Get away from me, before I get any stupid on me.
