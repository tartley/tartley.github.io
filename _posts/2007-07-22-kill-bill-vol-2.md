![Kill Bill Vol
2](http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/killbill.jpg){.alignleft
.floatright}*by Quentin Tarantino* (2004)\
[on imdb](http://imdb.com/title/tt0378194/)

Speaking of not having read Hamlet, did you see that awful Tarantino
quote recently? Something along the lines of "I mean, I haven't read any
Shakespeare, but people are keep comparing me to him, it's kinda
uncanny, you know?" Twazzock. 7/10.
