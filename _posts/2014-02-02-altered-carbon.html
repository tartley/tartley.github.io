  content: "Good old Richard Morgan.  It's all dripping with testosterone, so you
    do worry it's a bit trashy, but he does always manage to deliver slightly more
    than just the toughguy and the 'splosions.\r\n\r\nI recommend \"Market Forces\"
    for an ultra-bleak social commentary near-future take on the City of London..."

  content: I enjoyed all of his books. It's a shame he stopped after so few. I think
    he's doing Xbox stuff now...

<p>A romp through a hyperviolent cyberpunk future through the eyes of a character reluctantly press-ganged into the role of detective in a story woven around personality uploads, swaps, and backups.&nbsp;Thoroughly enjoyed it, but it was never going to be life-changing.</p>
<p>10/10 if you're looking to kick back on the couch with tea, cake, and some exciting SF.</p>
<p>0/10 if you're not.</p>
