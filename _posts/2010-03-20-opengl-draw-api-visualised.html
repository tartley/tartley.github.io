  content: "Nice diagram!\r\n\r\nI wonder how well SVG works after passing through
    a couple of RSS aggregators (Planet Python, then Google Reader).  I wouldn't be
    surprised to discover it doesn't survive their filtering, so thanks for the png."

    to keep all the different arrays in mind."

  content: A quick way to port this diagram for use with iPhone, i.e. generic vertex/fragment
    shaders, is to put attribute numbers for the v,c,n columns and rewrite the fixed
    pipeline functions in generic terms.  Could be a really cool active gif.

  content: "Thanks for the feedback, people.\r\n\r\nDonal: That sounds great, but
    I don't think I'm currently up to the task. My lappy only supports a subset of
    OpenGL 2.1, and I haven't really used buffers or shaders in anger.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    I'd be delighted to try and figure it out and to actually draw the diagram - especially
    if someone brainy such as yourself were to talk me through what it should look
    like. :-)"

  content: "Hey tito,\r\nYeah, you're absolutely right. I just felt compelled to include
    them in the diagram out of some sort of 'neatness' fetish. I can't justify it.
    I just liked showing they were the only API calls that connect directly to the
    verts, colors, etc, which other API calls refer to indirectly through indices
    or pointers. Foolish of me to label it 'opengl3.x' then. Good catch."

<p>To help me grok and remember the OpenGL 3.3 draw API, I drew them in a diagram. I hope this will help me see at a glance what I can and can't achieve with each function call.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1052" align="alignnone" width="691" caption="OpenGL 3.3 array draw calls"]<a href="http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/opengl-draw-calls.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1052" title="opengl-draw-calls" src="http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/opengl-draw-calls.png" alt="OpenGL array draw calls: glArrayElement; glDrawArrays; glMultiDrawArrays; glDrawElements; glMultiDrawElements" width="691" height="972" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>I haven't annotated any of the parameter types. These days I tend to be calling these functions from Python, so generally only care about the values. Interestingly, the most recent additions to the API, such as <code>glMultiDrawElements</code>, feature parameters such as '<code>const void ** indices</code>'. Apparently the OpenGL Architecture Review Board has also decided that they also no longer care about the types either. Wise choice. :-)</p>
<p><strong>Updatate:</strong> I wanted to publish this diagram as SVG, but apparently these days that works in every browser except IE, surprise surprise.</p>
