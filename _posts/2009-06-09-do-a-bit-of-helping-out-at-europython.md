Are you a [Python](http://python.org) geek?

For starters - you should totally be going to
[EuroPython](http://www.europython.eu/) at the end of June. Python
conferences like this attract brilliant presentations from some real
community and industry heavyweights. This year we've got [Professor Sir
Tony Hoare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare) (that's the creator
of [quicksort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) to you, amongst a
venerable lifetime's worth of other
things); [](http://blogs.msdn.com/hugunin/) [Cory
Doctorow](http://craphound.com/) (everyone's favourite science-fiction
author, blogger and all-round geek activist), [Bruce
Eckel](http://www.mindviewinc.com/Index.php) (author and renowned
technical communicator); plus Dr Sue Black from code-breaking hothouse
[Bletchley Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_park). The
[veritable horde](http://www.europython.eu/talks/timetable/) of over 100
exciting and interesting talks makes up probably the strongest line-up
EuroPython has ever had.

Best of all, Python conferences like this one are organised and run at a
grass-roots level. By enthusiasts, for enthusiasts, making them quite
the most fun, educational and interestingly social conferences I've ever
been to. Personally, I love the resultant absence of overriding
commercial agendas - everything is done purely for the benefit of the
delegates, and is pervaded by the community values that made you love
Python in the first place.

One upside of this is that the conference is cheap - only Â£190 to
attend. Interested enthusiasts can easily pay their own way. As a
result, this is one of the few technical conferences that still has a
robust attendance this year - both of presenters and delegates. Many
others have been decimated or even cancelled altogether.

There is a downside though, and here's the rub:

The good folks organising EuroPython in their spare time are desperately
short of volunteers to be session chairs.

If you're going to EuroPython, you could help out! Yes, YOU! You could
sign up for the sessions you want to watch anyway, so you shouldn't miss
anything. Just imagine the warm and fuzzies! The KUDOS of a roomful of
eyes. The POWER of cutting off over-running speakers in mid-flow\*. The
WARMTH of a deftly-cupped microphone.

(\*anyone cutting the power on Sir Tony will be duly ejected from the
premises)

Responsibilities are described in loving detail here:
<http://wiki.europython.eu/SessionTeam>

Please think about it, and if you fancy it, sign up soon (on the wiki
page above) because we're currently all a-flutter wondering how the heck
we're going to manage this. :-)

Thanks!
