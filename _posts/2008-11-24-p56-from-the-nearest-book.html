  content: "\"One of the major areas of research on unconscious processing to come
    out of the New Look involved perceptual defense, the demonstration that \"dirty\"
    words have a higher threshold for stimulus recognition than comparable words that
    lack sexual, scatological, or other taboo connotations.\"\r\n\r\n- from 'The Emotional
    Brain' by LeDoux."

    ever seen. Unless it's the best 'relevant-looking-but-actually-blatant-spam' comment
    I've ever seen. How could one ever know? I guess we'll find out when this page
    sprouts adverts for genital enhancements."

<p>Meme from <a href="http://www.planetpython.org/">unnofficial planet Python:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Grab the nearest book.</li>
<li>Open it to page 56.</li>
<li>Find the fifth sentence.</li>
<li>Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions.</li>
<li>Don't dig for your favorite book, the cool book, or the intellectual one: pick the CLOSEST.</li>
</ul>
<p>So here goes, are you ready for my entry? Hold on to your hats:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is an old birdwatchers' trick.</p></blockquote>
<p>from <em>Advanced Excel for Scientific Analysis</em> by Robert de Levie.</p>
<p>Stop that sniggering. It's not my fault. We're writing a spreadsheet-like-program, what else do you expect me to have on my desk? This is a dumb meme. Why am I doing it then? Excellent question.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> And why did I then forget to hit [publish] for two weeks?</p>
