![Lions for
Lambs](http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/lions-for-lambs.jpg){.floatleft}

It got a right drubbing critically, and was a box-office failure, but I
found it powerful and compelling. It may not be crafted with the
greatest finesse, but nevertheless it raises interesting and powerful
questions, of the competence of our leaders in war, of the culpability
of the media in towing the line, and of the personal responsibility that
falls to each of us.

Most Americans seem unaware that their [profligate spending on
'defence'](http://www.moblogic.tv/video/2008/03/10/whos-got-the-guns-2/),
coupled with regular invasions of other countries, cause them to be
regarded by much of the rest of the world as the single biggest threat
to world peace.

In such an environment, this movie asks us to have the bravery to let
our point of view be known, and to take action when our beliefs
contradict our Goverments' decision to go to war. For anyone with
questions about the justification for the recent wars that America has
started (and my own country England has supported) this movie raises
many issues, and spoke powerfully to my conscience.

Rating 8/10.
