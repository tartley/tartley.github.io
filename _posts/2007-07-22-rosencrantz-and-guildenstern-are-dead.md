![Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead](/assets/2007/07/rosencrantzandguildenstern.jpg)

*by Tom Stoppard*, 1990.
[On IMDB](http://imdb.com/title/tt0100519/)

I just can't decide how I feel about this. Part brilliant, part awful,
my most bipolar experience since [Everything and
More](http://tartley.com/?p=12). I guess I should 'fess up that I've
never actually seen or read Hamlet, either, which obviously can't help.
Oh deary. er... 5/10.
