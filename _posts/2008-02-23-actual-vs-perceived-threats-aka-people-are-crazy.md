    like the graph, I think it portrays a few ideas quite nicely, most noticeably
    the terrorist attack bubbles.  However, I am curious as to the size of the bubbles
    in ''Actual Hazard'' compared with one another.  Is the image claiming that we
    are significantly more in danger of being hit by an asteroid than by a terrorist
    attack?  I find that statistically hard to believe.  I would also question the
    morality of comparing most of these with seomthing like cancer.  While cancer
    is obviously the more common than any of these other incidents, I think its omni-presence
    dulls the perceived threat.  Yeah, we know that cancer can and will kill most
    of us, but is there any point in worrying about it?', date: '2008-02-25 22:01:44

![Actual vs Perceived
threats](http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/0aelecrtromshjoi9.jpg){.floatleft}[](http://www.susannahertrich.com/html/humansanimals.html)

[Susanna
Hertrich](http://www.susannahertrich.com/html/humansanimals.html) has an
art / thesis project to artificially stimulate people's threat
perceptions (by giving them goosebumps, or making hairs stand on end) in
response to *actual* threats, as opposed to perceived ones. It's a topic
that I'm unnaturally preoccupied with, since the most egregious examples
of the disparity between the two seem to intrude on my life every day.
My opinions about whether any given threat is real or illusiory seem to
differ from almost everyone, but I'm going to stubbornly cling to the
idea that everyone else is crazy. Take the entry on 'terrorist attack'
as an example (see diagram.) Public reactions to the topic remind me of
nothing so much as a stirred-up ants nest, a psychotic, ineffectual
frenzy.
