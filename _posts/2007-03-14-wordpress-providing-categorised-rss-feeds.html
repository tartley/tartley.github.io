  content: "Turns out it's easy. Simply substitute the category ID 'CATID' into the
    feed URL:\r\n\r\n  http://tartley.com/?feed=rss2&cat=CATID\r\n\r\nWhere CATID
    is an integer value that can be derived from the category URLs listed somewhere
    to the side of this article."

  content: Ha! Brilliant! I simply *had* to approve the spam comment above, because
    it's the best titled item I've ever received. There was a link, but I'll spare
    you from that.

<p>Apologies in advance to the <a href="http://londonpython.org.uk/">London Python</a> crowd, who I know are being force-fed these posts, for the bundle of non-Python-related updates they are about to receive. Can anyone go and look on the WordPress doc pages for me and figure out if there is plugin to make the RSS feeds it generates specific to a particular combo of site categories? Tar. :)</p>
