<p><img class="alignleft floatright" style="float: left;" alt="The Straight Story" src="http://tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/thestraightstory.jpg" /><em>by David Lynch</em> (1999)<br />

<p>Aw, heck, I dunno. It's kinda down to Earth and charming, but also plain and slow-moving. And sure, that was deliberate, it wanted to tell a simple, powerful story in the terms of its protagonists, within the context of rural life. But I couldn't really get into it, despite really wanting to. Some of the acting was a bit lacking. IMDB informs me that it's a true story. Fair enough. It's still 4/10.</p>
