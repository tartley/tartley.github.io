  content: "Your post raises a deep philosophical question, does 0/0 mean it has got
    full mark?, after all it has got all possible points and also it has got nothing,
    Nice Paradox\r\n\r\nThanks for making me think"

  content: "0/0 means that it can't be rated: no points are on offer.\r\n\r\nI think
    you should have little icons next to the ratings. Here are the alt texts:\r\n\r\n10/10
    \"Purr!\"\r\n0/10 \"Hiss! Meow!\""

<p><em>by Edward R. Tufte</em> (1990)</p>
<p>In much the same vein as Tufte's <em>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</em>, and displaying the same calibre of deeply incisive common-sense that cuts to the heart of all that's right and wrong about the art and science of 'information design' - graphic design's more pragmatic nephew.</p>
<p>If you love beauty in highly functional graphics, from maps and diagrams, charts and graphs, tables and typography, then this is for you.</p>
<p>Rating:</p>
<p>10/10 If bad diagrams make you cringe, and good ones make you laugh out loud.</p>
<p>0/10 If you only care about beauty, but not about usefulness. Or if you don't have eyes.</p>
