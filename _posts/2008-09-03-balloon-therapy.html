<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-377" title="balloon" src="http://www.tartley.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/balloon.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="360" /><strong>by Ivan Idso</strong>, 2007 ish.</p>
<p>A disclaimer, to begin - the author is my new-to-me brother in law, so I got a copy at cost, inscribed 'soft aardvarks' (I think), and a few weeks later got a once-in-a-lifetime experience of being taken on a balloon ride by the man himself. So the write-up is going to be a glowing one.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I don't have to stretch the truth at all in order to do so. It's a short and lightweight read, which does explain the mechanics and practicalities of hot-air ballooning. However, the focus of the book is on the social aspects, and the effect it has had on the life and disposition of Ivan, his family and friends. As a result, it's a thoroughly personal and heart-warming read, engrossing and explanatory and fulfilling throughout, that left me feeling closer to the author, and with more of an understanding of him and his lifestyle.</p>
