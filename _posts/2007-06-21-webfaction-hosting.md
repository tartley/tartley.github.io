[![WebFaction - hosting for an agile
web.](http://tartley.webfactional.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/webfaction.thumbnail.png){.alignleft}](http://www.webfaction.com/ "WebFaction - hosting for an agile web."){.floatleft}If
you can see this post, then tartley.com successfully switched to
[WebFaction](http://www.webfaction.com/ "WebFaction - hosting for an agile web.")
for our hosting, thanks to the resounding recommendations of Michael,
and the genial-but-highly-competent aura emanating from the big cheese,
Remi Delon. Shell access, Linux environment, open-source friendly,
Wordpress directly catered for. I'm a happy bunny. Thanks all round.
Maybe now I can finally get around to putting that photo gallery up?
