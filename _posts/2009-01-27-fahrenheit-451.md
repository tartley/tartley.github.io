![Farneheit 451](/assets/2009/01/farneheit_451.jpg)

*by Ray Bradbury*, 1953.

A tale of future urban America, in which political or critical thought
is suppressed by overwhelming popular entertainment and by burning all
books, told with Bradbury's typical simple and beautiful prose. Rarely
has a tale suffused me with such peace and tranquillity than my making
the transition from the frantic, advertising-saturated dystopia into the
moonlit fields and abandoned railroads of the closing chapters.

The novel has a curiously bifurcated message for modern times. We would
seem to be even more overwhelmed by noisy and crass distractions of
types unimaginable in Bradbury's time, often unable to pry ourselves
free from a myriad compelling sources of entertainment.

However, for all the negative impact this internet may have had on our
peace of mind and our attention spans, it has also provided tremendous
benefits that to a great extent defuse the novel's warnings. Books are
now infinitely reproduceable. Dissenting thought or new ideas can easily
be published and read by millions, free from fear of retribution by
employers or governments, those [weary giants of flesh and
steel](http://homes.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html). Writing by
any person in the world is routinely disseminated to and from the
furthest corners of the globe in seconds. Instantly findable. Free from
censorship. Archived forever. Unburnable.

This ease-of-use provides each of us with exactly what we demand of it.
Just as Bradbury foretells, those of a studious mind, those with
legitimate concerns, those with a desire to change the world or make
something more out of life, these people will always gather to talk and
plan and act. Only now, they can do so globally, instantly and
effectively. For each of us, our salvation requires only that we choose
to save ourselves.

Rating:

10/10 if you fancy a bit of charming retro SF with a beautiful turn of
phrase

0/10 if you think worrying about fulfilment in life, political affairs,
or meaning in life is a big waste of time, especially if it's done by
way of science-fiction metaphors and hyperthetical future scenarios.
Let's go shopping!
