    Interestingly, it seems that historically, there were a whole slew of clefs, to
    denote staves with various different offsets. One of these, the <i>sub-bass clef</i>,
    which looks like a bass-clef but is offset exactly two notes upwards, has exactly
    the desirable octave offset property that I describe above. However, all these
    other clefs fell into disuse or minority uses for various reasons, leaving us
    with the two most commonly-used ones remaining today. A functional equivalent
    to the sub-bass clef is the <i>octave clef</i>, which looks like a treble-clef
    decorated with a stylised ''8'', and is apparently sometimes used to denote tenor
    parts for vocal choirs.', date: '2007-05-18 14:17:06 -0500', date_gmt: '2007-05-18

![Treble clef](/assets/2007/05/treble-clef.jpg)

I've been riding high on the sheer joy that is Guitar Hero II (PS2) recently.
Now that *Psychobilly Freakout* is the only remaining song for which a
five-star review performance is still eluding me, before unleashing the
masochistically feverish *hard* difficulty setting at least, it's time
for me to get my ass into gear and learn to play a *real* musical
instrument.

Dithering
between piano / keyboard and acoustic / electric guitar, I've decided to
take a few week's lessons in each, to see which initially suits me best.
Accordingly (Speaking of which, I also find the accordion strangely
compelling), I had my first ever piano lesson this weekend.

[![Mr Marios Takoushis](/assets/2007/05/marious.jpg)](http://www.mariostakoushis.com/html/about.php "Mr Marios Takoushis")

My tutor,
[Marios](http://www.mariostakoushis.com/html/about.php), an amiable
Greek professional musician with appropriately mad hair, seems like a
brilliant choice thus far: I'm sure we'll get along famously, with only
the minimum amount of absolutely necessary knuckle-rapping.

**Update 14:35:** Just remembered: One of the first puzzling things I
discovered is that notes on the bass clef stave are offset from the
notes on the treble clef stave by a non-integer number of octaves.
Hence, a note which would represent 'C' on a treble clef stave is
actually an 'E' when drawn on a bass clef stave. Presumably there's a
reason for this, but I've yet to hear an explanation that sounds like
anything other than a wart on the notation. Can any of my multitudinous
readers enlighten me?
