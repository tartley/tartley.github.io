The old tartley.com used to have one of these, so here's a quickie
replacement. It tends to overstate the case somewhat, a single foray
across a border floods entire countries. I'd imagine good old Google's
freebie geospatial tools could be put to use to create a better one, but
for the time being, here's an amusing approximation. I'd be amused to
see Skankmeister's version.

[Create your own visited countries and states
maps.](http://douweosinga.com/projects/visitedstates) Or else go check
out [Uncle Nixta's
version](http://nixtasinks.nixta.com/2007/05/travel-accuratification.html),
from whence I got the inspiration.
