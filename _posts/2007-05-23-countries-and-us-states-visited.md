The old tartley.com used to have one of these, so here's a quickie
replacement. It tends to overstate the case somewhat, a single foray
across a border floods entire countries. I'd imagine good old Google's
freebie geospatial tools could be put to use to create a better one, but
for the time being, here's an amusing approximation. I'd be amused to
see Skankmeister's version. Layovers don't count - bone fide visits only.
