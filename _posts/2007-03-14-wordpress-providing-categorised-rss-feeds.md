Apologies in advance to the [London Python](http://londonpython.org.uk/)
crowd, who I know are being force-fed these posts, for the bundle of
non-Python-related updates they are about to receive. Can anyone go and
look on the WordPress doc pages for me and figure out if there is plugin
to make the RSS feeds it generates specific to a particular combo of
site categories? Tar. :)
