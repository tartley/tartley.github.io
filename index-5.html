<p>That's the new "reimagined" version, Dad. I don't really do much
television, and for 2006, downloads of Battlestar was pretty much the
only exception. It's edgy and well-written, and it leaves me
breathlessly excited, and yes it had that lull on New Caprica about five
episodes in, but then it blossomed again, experimenting with one-off
shows, cool ideas, and great characters that remain emotive and
involving while staying well clear of Dawson's Creek. And what a series
finale! Blowing the whole stack of Cylon sleeper agents all at once, the
awful yawning realisation as they each heard the activation signal in
the back of their minds, all drawn to converge on the same room, what a
headfuck, with the psychedelic nebula backdrops all around, to the
rising strains of <em>All Along the Watchtower</em>, as Apollo discovers
Starbuck is still alive. Hooray! Loved it loved it loved it. 8/10.</p>

<p><em>by David Lynch (1999)</em></p>
<p>Aw, heck, I dunno. It's kinda down to Earth and charming, but also plain
and slow-moving. And sure, that was deliberate, it wanted to tell a
simple, powerful story in the terms of its protagonists, within the
context of rural life. But I couldn't really get into it, despite really
wanting to. Some of the acting was a bit lacking. IMDB informs me that
it's a true story. Fair enough. It's still 4/10.</p>

<p>Blink is by the same guy who wrote <em>Tipping Point</em>, which I never read,
and was another foolish airport buy, induced by the sheer peer pressure
of it being popular. It features enough content to fill three or four
fairly interesting blog posts about the under-utilised ability of the
subconscious mind to come to rapid decisions which are sometimes
inordinately useful but rarely trusted in our left-brain dominated
society. This was then padded out to the length of an entirely
unnecessary paperback. 3/10.</p>

<p><em>by Alan Moore (author), Eddie Campbell (artist) (1989)</em></p>
<p>Moore has almost single-handedly transformed the definition of the comic
industry in the last 20 years, and this fetishistically researched
comic-book dramatisation of the dark and macabre Jack the Ripper murders
is no exception to his visionary high standards.</p>
<p><span style="background:#bb2200; color:white; border-radius: 1em; padding-left: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em; padding-top: 2px;"><b>spoilers</b></span></p>
<p>Moore plunges headlong into the sensational conspiracy theory that Royal
Physician, Dr. William Gull, killed East End prostitutes to silence the story
of an illegitimate royal baby, under the direct orders of the implacable Queen
Victoria herself.</p>
<p>Dr Gull regards his mission as the great work of his life, which will
not only quash the threat to the crown, but also fulfil ancient pagan
destinies, reasserting the male dominance over matriarchy that began
when the Romans reclaimed London and slew Queen Boadicea. Gull knows
this because he has knelt before his God, who told him just what needed
to be done. As a doctor, Gull knows that these visions are madness,
brought about by his stroke of the previous year. As a man, however, he
responds that "If this is madness, who'd be sane?", and, embracing the
subjective reality of his hallucinations, he goes about his work with
gusto, confiding along the way in his witless coachman and reluctant
accomplice, Nettley.</p>
<p><img alt="Dr Gull and coachman Nettley" src="files/2007/07/boadicea-died-sm.jpg" title="Dr. Gull &amp; coachman Nettley"></p>
<p>The story is a tapestry, woven on many levels. The iniquities of wealth
and power are richly depicted as the poverty-stricken residents of the
East End are contrasted with the powers-that-be, who move swiftly and
decisively to ensure that Gull is never caught nor found out, for fear
of scandal, even while he goes on killing with impunity.</p>
<p>The appalling violence of the murders and dismemberment of the victims
is shown in unflinching detail, one pivotal 34-page chapter "The Best of
all Tailors", consisting solely of the actions of Gull, a renowned
surgeon, with his victim in a tiny, squalid room, which made me
profoundly grateful that the sketches are only in black-and-white.</p>
<p>Such graphic nastiness is not for no reason. Gull is convinced that the
act of violence is a pivotal part of the ancient and grisly prophesies
he is enacting. Under the psychological strain of each successive
murder, Gull experiences increasingly vivid hallucinations, symptoms of
his condition. But then, something altogether strange starts to happen.
As his visions become more vivid, Gull begins to experience glimpses of
the future. Visions of our time. At times and places where people have
historically claimed to have seen the ghost of Jack the Ripper, Moore
cunningly reverses the perspective, allowing Gull to see them also. By
the end, Gull's visions have him stalking the sterile hallways of the
modern world in blood-soaked shirtsleeves, roaring at oblivious office
workers, exhorting them to look up and remember the history from which
our century was birthed in blood. The ancient magic that Gull raved
about was real, while we have lost our connection to our violent and
animal past, and with it, our very humanity.</p>

    <p>Google Calendar tells me that I've now had 8 piano lessons with the
esteemed Marios. It's been heaps of fun, and it's long past time I
shared my progress to date, in the form of some ghastly midi files.
Download at your peril, they are truly awful - only of interest as a
record of my progress.</p>
<h5>Beautiful Brown Eyes</h5>
<p>First, a tune labelled as 'Beautiful Brown Eyes'. This is from a couple
of weeks ago, the first time I managed to record a midi file. The
timing's very sloppy - I haven't been learning any pieces by heart, so
I'm struggling to read the music fast enough to play the tune. I'm
trying to play as many different pieces as I can by reading the sheet
music, rather than learning a few by heart, since that will hopefully
exercise my ability to read music, albeit at the cost of sounding much
less polished for the time being. That's my excuse and I'm sticking to
it!</p>

28 Jun</p>
<h5>Alpine Melody</h5>
<p>Next up, an even simpler tune, which means I have less difficulty
reading the music and so the timing's a bit better.</p>
<p><a href="files/2007/07/07-07-16-alpine-melody.mid" title="Alpine Melody, 2007-07-16"><img alt="MIDI icon" src="files/2007/07/midifile.jpg"></a>
16 Jul</p>
<h5>Tetris</h5>
<p>Finally, the music from the computer game Tetris. This is a fairly new
tune to me, and it's obvious that it's a real struggle. I'm not used to
reading such large melodic intervals, and the notes extends over a
broader pitch range than anything I've done before, so I can scarcely
place my fingers on the right keys, never mind in time. Hopefully this
will get better with practice.</p>

festival season. True to its image as one of the newer and smaller
festivals in the UK, Latitude had a good-natured crowd, diverse music -
albeit without many big-name bands, was laid-back and eclectic, and not
too muddy.</p>

<p>The defining highlight for me was a showing of <em>The Adventures of
Prince Achmed</em> (1926) (<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0015532/">IMDB</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Prince_Achmed">Wikipedia</a>),
a beautiful rendition of tales from Arabian Nights, using stop-motion
shadow-puppetry, accompanied by a haunting live musical soundtrack by <a href="http://www.myspace.com/littlesparta">Little
Sparta</a>. I've wanted to see the movie for
ages - it is the oldest surviving feature-length animation, and was brought
about by the dedication of one woman, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotte_Reiniger,">Lotte
Reiniger</a> who single-handedly
constructed all the cutouts in the movie using nothing more than scissors, and
then animated them all by hand.</p>
