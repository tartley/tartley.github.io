<p>Blink is by the same guy who wrote <em>Tipping Point</em>, which I never read,
and was another foolish airport buy, induced by the sheer peer pressure
of it being popular. It features enough content to fill three or four
fairly interesting blog posts about the under-utilised ability of the
subconscious mind to come to rapid decisions which are sometimes
inordinately useful but rarely trusted in our left-brain dominated
society. This was then padded out to the length of an entirely
unnecessary paperback. 3/10.</p>

<p><em>by Alan Moore (author), Eddie Campbell (artist) (1989)</em> <img alt="spoilers" src="files/spoilers.svg"></p>
<p>Moore has almost single-handedly transformed the definition of the comic
industry in the last 20 years, and this fetishistically researched
comic-book dramatisation of the dark and macabre Jack the Ripper murders
is no exception to his visionary high standards. Moore plunges headlong
into the sensational conspiracy theory that Royal Physician, Dr. William
Gull, killed East End prostitutes to silence the story of an
illegitimate royal baby, under the direct orders of the implacable Queen
Victoria herself.</p>
<p>Dr Gull regards his mission as the great work of his life, which will
not only quash the threat to the crown, but also fulfil ancient pagan
destinies, reasserting the male dominance over matriarchy that began
when the Romans reclaimed London and slew Queen Boadicea. Gull knows
this because he has knelt before his God, who told him just what needed
to be done. As a doctor, Gull knows that these visions are madness,
brought about by his stroke of the previous year. As a man, however, he
responds that "If this is madness, who'd be sane?", and, embracing the
subjective reality of his hallucinations, he goes about his work with
gusto, confiding along the way in his witless coachman and reluctant
accomplice, Nettley.</p>
<p><img alt="Dr Gull and coachman Nettley" src="files/2007/07/boadicea-died-sm.jpg" title="Dr. Gull &amp; coachman Nettley"></p>
<p>The story is a tapestry, woven on many levels. The iniquities of wealth
and power are richly depicted as the poverty-stricken residents of the
East End are contrasted with the powers-that-be, who move swiftly and
decisively to ensure that Gull is never caught nor found out, for fear
of scandal, even while he goes on killing with impunity.</p>
<p>The appalling violence of the murders and dismemberment of the victims
is shown in unflinching detail, one pivotal 34-page chapter "The Best of
all Tailors", consisting solely of the actions of Gull, a renowned
surgeon, with his victim in a tiny, squalid room, which made me
profoundly grateful that the sketches are only in black-and-white.</p>
<p>Such graphic nastiness is not for no reason. Gull is convinced that the
act of violence is a pivotal part of the ancient and grisly prophesies
he is enacting. Under the psychological strain of each successive
murder, Gull experiences increasingly vivid hallucinations, symptoms of
his condition. But then, something altogether strange starts to happen.
As his visions become more vivid, Gull begins to experience glimpses of
the future. Visions of our time. At times and places where people have
historically claimed to have seen the ghost of Jack the Ripper, Moore
cunningly reverses the perspective, allowing Gull to see them also. By
the end, Gull's visions have him stalking the sterile hallways of the
modern world in blood-soaked shirtsleeves, roaring at oblivious office
workers, exhorting them to look up and remember the history from which
our century was birthed in blood. The ancient magic that Gull raved
about was real, while we have lost our connection to our violent and
animal past, and with it, our very humanity.</p>

<p>Google Calendar tells me that I've now had 8 piano lessons with the
esteemed Marios. It's been heaps of fun, and it's long past time I
shared my progress to date, in the form of some ghastly midi files.
Download at your peril, they are truly awful - only of interest as a
record of my progress.</p>
<h5>Beautiful Brown Eyes</h5>
<p>First, a tune labelled as 'Beautiful Brown Eyes'. This is from a couple
of weeks ago, the first time I managed to record a midi file. The
timing's very sloppy - I haven't been learning any pieces by heart, so
I'm struggling to read the music fast enough to play the tune. I'm
trying to play as many different pieces as I can by reading the sheet
music, rather than learning a few by heart, since that will hopefully
exercise my ability to read music, albeit at the cost of sounding much
less polished for the time being. That's my excuse and I'm sticking to
it!</p>

28 Jun</p>
<h5>Alpine Melody</h5>
<p>Next up, an even simpler tune, which means I have less difficulty
reading the music and so the timing's a bit better.</p>
<p><a href="files/2007/07/07-07-16-alpine-melody.mid" title="Alpine Melody, 2007-07-16"><img alt="MIDI icon" src="files/2007/07/midifile.jpg"></a>
16 Jul</p>
<h5>Tetris</h5>
<p>Finally, the music from the computer game Tetris. This is a fairly new
tune to me, and it's obvious that it's a real struggle. I'm not used to
reading such large melodic intervals, and the notes extends over a
broader pitch range than anything I've done before, so I can scarcely
place my fingers on the right keys, never mind in time. Hopefully this
will get better with practice.</p>

<p>It's summertime again, even in sodden old England, and that means it's
festival season. True to its image as one of the newer and smaller
festivals in the UK, Latitude had a good-natured crowd, diverse music -
albeit without many big-name bands, was laid-back and eclectic, and not
too muddy.</p>
<p><a href="files/2007/07/prince-achmed.jpg" title="Prince Achmed"><img alt="Prince Achmed" src="files/2007/07/prince-achmed.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The defining highlight for me was a showing of <em><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0015532/">The Adventures of
Prince Achmed</a></em> (1926), a beautiful
rendition of tales from Arabian Nights, using stop-motion
shadow-puppetry, accompanied by a haunting live musical soundtrack by
<a href="http://www.myspace.com/littlesparta">Little Sparta</a>. I've wanted to see
the movie for ages - it is the first ever feature-length animation, and
was brought about by the dedication of one woman, Lotte Reiniger, who
single-handedly constructed all the cutouts in the movie using nothing
more than scissors, and then animated them all by hand.</p>

<p>Ken Arnold posted about the <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/arnold/archive/2005/06/generics_consid_1.html">problems with
generics</a>,
namely that they substantially increase code complexity without
providing commensurate benefits.</p>
<p>He's spot on - generics are the programming language feature that never
should have happened, and I speak as someone who, when I was a heavy
user of C++, <em>loved</em> generics. Even now I yearn for the elegant
consistency of the Standard Template Library. But the points Ken makes
from a Java perspective apply equally well to C++, and C# as well. That
generics increase both the semantic and syntactic complexity of code is
undeniable. Their benefit as a runtime type-checking mechanism <em>does</em>
prevent - or at least help diagnose - certain classes of bug. But these
bugs are not generally especially common, nor difficult to diagnose or
fix in the first place. This can be seen quite clearly when considering
that dynamic languages, which enforce no type checking at all, do not
suffer in development effort nor code maintainability as a result - if
anything, they demonstrate the converse.</p>
<p>One benefit that Ken doesn't mention is the use of generics to signal a
programmer's intent - to make a collection homogeneous is, to a limited
extent, to make it self-documenting. Again though, this benefit is small
compared to the complexity costs.</p>
<p>When I started typing I thought I had more of a point. Ho hum.</p>

<p>I loved a <a href="http://geothought.blogspot.com/2007/06/thoughts-on-ges-next-generation-system.html">recent
post</a>
by GIS luminary Peter Batty about forthcoming developments in the GIS
industry. However, I was struck by his allusions to a future release of
Smallworld which would dispense of the problems caused by the common
practice of individual clients writing custom software to tailor the
system to their specific needs, by allowing sufficient data-driven
customisation out of the box. I wrote a response which I think I'm going
to post here as well. Suck it up.</p>
<p>My interest and excitement was tinged with a frisson of trepidation, at
the description of the configurable GIS behaviour. I know there's a
whole phalanx of very smart engineers at GE, who are no doubt
immeasurably more cognisant of the following issues than myself. But, as
is my wont, I'm not going to let that get in the way of an opportunity
for a jolly good rant, so here goes.</p>
<p>Obviously data driven behaviour is brilliant. However, it's only good up
to a point. Once the behaviour in question becomes complex enough (and a
GIS definitely qualifies), there's a real risk of the <a href="http://worsethanfailure.com/Articles/The_Inner-Platform_Effect.aspx">Inner Platform
effect</a>:
In an effort to achieve the same levels of flexibility as the
programming languages that it is designed to replace, the configuration
system ends up replicating all their features - badly.</p>
<p>Such an endeavour is caught between two stools. If it is insufficiently
ambitious, the configuration will not be flexible enough to meet
clients' needs. If it does manages to capture the power of the
programming languages it replaces, then it is Turing complete, and all
you have done is convert customisation using a standard, proven,
well-known programming language into configuration using a ghastly
proprietary language that is embedded within your configuration schema.</p>
<p>In addition, creating such a configuration actually ends up being much
harder for clients. It requires deep proprietary skills, as opposed to
common skills like C#, and it cannot lean on any of the supportive
ecosystem of tools and knowledge that an established language has built
up over the years. Perhaps worst of all, it will *still* require
software engineering skills to perform the configuration, and all the
good software engineers will have run a mile.</p>
<p>Like I say, no doubt there are smart people at GE who have been figuring
out solutions to all this for years by now, but I'd have to hear what
those solutions were before I'd trust such a system.</p>
<p>To my way of thinking, the best solution to the problem is to
acknowledge that the best way of specifying behaviour is to use a
programming language - that is exactly what they were designed for.
Trying to sidestep that is simply swimming against the current, and you
need to embrace it. You want a domain specific language (DSL), so that
it is concise and intuitive for clients, but you don't want it to be a
proprietary language - that way lies madness. So what you need is to
provide is a library that extends an existing, established language,
making it into your GIS DSL. Creating DSLs from Python or Ruby is all
the rage these days, and I believe the above chain of reasoning is why.</p>
