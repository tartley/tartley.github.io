<p>This is pretty much a riff on what I posted yesterday, only this is my
draft for how I intend to present it to my MP tomorrow. I have no idea
how much time I'll have, nor how receptive he'll be. This may all be a
big waste of time, but just in case, this is my plan, such as it is.</p>
<p>If you think any part of this is idiotic, or that I've misunderstood how
the relevant bits of the Bill work, or that I'm belabouring some points
at the expense of other, more important ones, then I'd really love to
hear about it. The last thing I want is for some stupid part of my
argument to undermine the other parts of it.</p>
<p><strong>The Digital Economy Bill</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldbills/001/10001.i-ii.html">http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldbills/001/10001.i-ii.html</a></p>
<p>I want to clarify at the outset that I absolutely support the importance
of copyright law, its enforcement, and give my full support to the
expectation of artists to be remunerated in a market-driven manner. I do
not want the following arguments to be confused with those which suggest
that copyright should be abolished, or everything online should be
free.</p>
<p><em>(This bit is my attempt to establish some credibility and rapport. In
reality, I think copyright, although sound in principle, is sorely in
need of substantial revision, namely it should be much shorter in
duration, should have larger and more explicit exceptions, and should
require pro-active registering and renewal by the rights holder. But
those concerns are orthogonal to the Digital Economy Bill in its current
form, and raising them here would only confuse the issue.)</em></p>
<p>As a computer programmer, I am directly affected by illegal downloads.
Almost everything I have created professionally has subsequently been
available online for illegal download - affecting my own income and the
financial viability of my employers, such as my current small technology
start-up. <em>(This is not entirely true - some military projects I have
worked on have not suffered any piracy, due to having, shall we say,
extravagant hardware requirements)</em></p>
<p>However, even with that background, I still have strong objections to
the sections of the bill 4 through 17, which attempt to redress the harm
done to the creative industries by the elimination of illegal
downloading.</p>
<p>I believe this pursuit of illegal downloaders comes with problems that
are so profound as to make this portion of the bill counter-productive -
and I believe that a superior alternative course of action does exist,
that would be of substantially more benefit to artists.</p>
<p>The problems as I perceive them are:</p>
<p><strong>1. Disconnection affects many innocents.</strong></p>
<p>Regarding the Obligations to Limit Access described in section 11.</p>
<p>Almost every internet connection is used by more than one person. For
example family members, or independent parties in a shared house.</p>
<p>Disconnection of persistent illegal downloaders will therefore impact
all these other users of the shared connection. The innocent users
disconnected by this legislation will greatly outnumber the illegal
downloaders being targeted!</p>
<p>This similarly also applies to the other, lesser remedies described by
section 11, of affecting service speed or access to particular
materials.</p>
<p>This is flagrantly unfair - a whole household of innocent people are
being punished because of the actions of one guilty person.</p>
<p>Infringing downloads may not even have originated from a resident of the
house. They could easily have been made a dinner guest - very possibly
without the resident's knowledge, and yet they are to be collectively
punished for it. Are hosts expected to prevent this by searching every
guest to their house, demanding guests hand over their phones and other
devices?</p>
<p>This idea is equally problematic when considering publicly available
internet connections, such as at libraries, airports, coffee-shops, etc.
Are they to be disconnected when one of their customers infringes?</p>
<p>My conclusion: Disconnection and the other remedies described in section
11 are not, under any circumstances, appropriate courses of action, even
for the most egregious offenders, and more conventional remedies should
be considered instead.</p>
<p><strong>2. Impossibility of distinguishing guilt from innocence</strong></p>
<p>Several times a week, I routinely download many dozens of online media
from my home collection, to wherever I happen to be at the time - the
office, at a conference, travelling overseas. These are on the whole
media I have previously bought - music or movies or computer programs or
games. I have ripped these legally purchased items to my computer
precisely so that I would have the freedom to move them geographically,
and to format-shift them from one device to another.</p>
<p>To any external observer, these downloads are indistinguishable from an
illegal download. Copying of the exact same songs is involved in each
case. The external observer cannot know that I have already bought the
music or movie or whatever in question.</p>
<p>If I were accused of illegal downloading under this law, which I
apparently would be on a very regular basis, then would have no way of
defending myself against these false accusations. I cannot produce proof
of purchase for all of the media I have purchased over my whole
lifetime.</p>
<p>If it came down to producing the physical media as evidence, such as CDs
my songs came on, then of course many of my songs were purchased online,
and the CDs I bought years ago were discarded as soon as I had ripped
them, in celebration of my freedom from the constraints of physical
media.</p>
<p>Similarly, my accuser, upon whom I believe the onus of proof should lie,
cannot prove the negative (that I never bought the media in question.)
So it is impossible to distinguish the guilty from the innocent, and</p>
<p><strong>3. Chilling effect</strong></p>
<p>The presumption of guilt inherent in the Bill will clearly have a
chilling effect on my personal use of the internet as described above.
The <em>raison d'ÃƒÂªtre</em> of the internet is to facilitate the copying of
information from one place to another, and yet my perfectly innocuous
desire to use it for exactly that is, in this instance, prevented for
fear of me being tarred with the same brush as illegal downloaders.</p>
<p>If this were the full extent of the chilling effect that the bill will
have, then it is arguable that this is a regrettable but acceptable
collateral damage in the struggle to recompense artists. However, this
is not the only action that is chilled by the Bill's presumption of
guilt.</p>
<p><em>TODO, this section is weak, and represents what I think is the most
important problem. At the very least, more compelling examples are
needed here</em></p>
<p>Artists exchanging material while collaborating on a project, or or
someone downloading music that they themselves wrote, or business model
that involves copying media from one place to another, all would be
under risk from invoking the penalty of 'illegal downloads', and will be
prevented from occurring.</p>
<p>Personal freedoms and business models of both the present and the future
will be inhibited by the presumption of guilt that the pursuit of
file-sharers requires.</p>
<p>This is, to my mind, the most serious of all the problems with the
Bill's pursuit of illegal downloaders. Instead of stimulating the
digital economy, these measures seem to me to stifle it, by pandering to
the wishes of existing special interests, at the expense of personal
freedoms and the emerging business models of the future.</p>
<p><strong>4. No provision to clarify the legality of innocent use</strong></p>
<p>It is disappointing that the bill does not take the opportunity to make
actions which are both common and morally justifiable clearly and
explicitly legal.</p>
<p>I am thinking here of actions such as my space-shifting of the files I
own, as described above, and of format-shifting between different
devices.</p>
<p>These actions do not in any way represent a valid 'lost sale', and have
absolutely no negative effect on the content industry's business, other
than countering unreasonable attempts to force consumers to purchase the
same media several times over.</p>
<p>Removing the uncertainty about these actions would free individuals from
the lurking threat of frivolous prosecution over harmless activities,
and would foster innovation by giving business some guidelines about
exactly what is allowed.</p>
<p><strong>5. Intrusive state monitoring of everyone's online actions</strong></p>
<p>I strongly object to the notion of the ISPs, acting as representatives
of the State, monitoring every single action that I and my family and my
friends carry out online. It is ripe for abuse, for the information
falling into the wrong hands, and for leaving me under suspicion due to
clerical or other errors during the collection or storage of the data.
It is absolutely unacceptable to me.</p>
<p><strong>6. Lack of substantive evidence that artists income has really
dropped</strong></p>
<p>As stated initially, the goal of ensuring artists are suitably
remunerated for their creations is a laudable one, that I fully support.</p>
<p>Crucially though, the purported losses incurred by the music and movie
industries are commonly derived from flawed studies, directly funded by
the industries in question, and frequently make fundamental mistakes
such as equating every download made with a lost sale. More substantive
information than this is required about the size of the problem.</p>
<p>Indeed, some figures show that the music industry has in fact grown very
healthily in the last few years. For example, these figures compiled and
published by The Times on 12th November 2009, based on the BPI's own
data:</p>
<p><a href="http://labs.timesonline.co.uk/blog/2009/11/12/do-music-artists-do-better-in-a-world-with-illegal-file-sharing/">http://labs.timesonline.co.uk/blog/2009/11/12/do-music-artists-do-better-in-a-world-with-illegal-file-sharing/</a></p>
<p>This suggests that since 2004, recorded music incomes in the UK have
fallen by some Â£326M. Whether this is due to illegal downloading is not
known - presumably it is partly due to that, and partly due to other
factors, such as the music industry putting out fewer records in recent
years. However, the same figures also show that over the same period,
income from live music and merchandising have risen by the larger amount
of Â£373M. The industry as a whole is around Â£47M better off, and as a
bonus, the proportion of this income which is paid directly to artists
has risen dramatically, since artists make more money from live shows
than from recorded music sales.</p>
<p>This fits with my own personal experience - free downloads act as a
tremendous promotional boost for bands. I have many friends who are able
to try out far more music as a result of its availability online, and as
a result are far more active in attending live music events, often of
bands they would not otherwise have heard of, had they not discovered
them online.</p>
<p>If this is true, then free downloads cause artists to lose money via
recorded music, but also to gain more in recompense through other
channels. In this case, do we really need heavy-handed legislation to
protect their interests, if the legislation in question comes with all
the other costs described here? If artists really are earning more than
they were five years ago, do we need to introduce the chilling effects
this bill will cause on the rest of the economy in order to try and help
them out? What if the pursuit of illegal downloaders means that revenues
in live music then drops back to their previous lower levels? Artists
will have actually been financially hurt by this bill. This needs to be
understood before taking such drastic actions as the bill proposes.</p>
<p><strong>7. One alternative</strong></p>
<p>TODO: Lay out the "central pool to remunerate artists in proportion to
their number of downloads" idea, merely to make it clear that there are
alternatives courses of action which could be used to tackle this
situation, which seem to come with real incentives to stimulate the
digital and creative economies, and with smaller, more soluble problems
than Digital Economy Bill in its current form.</p>

<p>So my splendid talented intelligent handsome friend Robert (who is also
my boss, of sorts) today shared this smashing post:</p>
<p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5417318/my-6247-royalty-statement-how-major-labels-cook-the-books-with-digital-downloads">My \$62.47 Royalty Statement: How Major Labels Cook the Books with
Digital
Downloads</a></p>
<p>About one aspect of how artists get ripped off by the labels. It's not
required reading, but you can if you like. I'll wait.</p>
<p>Hey. So it made me realise that a very possible fix to the dreadful
abuse of artists by the labels is possible. Even better, the solution to
this appalling situation is also the solution to the dire problems with
the UK's Digital Economy Bill.</p>
<p>So the UK govt. are debating a new bill, part of which introduces
measures to ruthlessly pursue illegal downloaders. There are some
problems with this, namely that:</p>
<ul>
<li>someone (probably the ISPs) will have to monitor what everyone
    downloads, and report people downloading anything that trips their
    filters for 'copyrighted work'. Understandably, they don't want to
    do this.</li>
<li>It will cost lots to implement - currently estimated at 100
    million, but of course the ensuing arms race with encrypted
    downloads will inflate that. Has anyone compared this with the
    <em>actual</em> economic losses that it is aiming to fix? (not just the
    inflated ones self-reported by those with most to gain.)</li>
<li>It is literally impossible to automatically detect breach of
    copyright accurately - it can't be done just by looking at the bits.
    There will be lots of false positives and false negatives.</li>
<li>It will be easy to get around, using encryption or similar
    technologies to evade detection. It will not fix the problem it aims
    to fix.</li>
<li>It requires representatives of the state to intrusively monitor
    every single thing we do online.</li>
<li>The false positives will target and punish many innocent people,
    who have no way to demonstrate their innocence.</li>
<li>Perhaps worst of all, its presumption of guilt will have a chilling
    effect on many legal and morally justifiable uses of the internet,
    including business models of the present and the future.</li>
<li>They are talking about disconnection from the internet as a
    potential punitive measure for persistent downloaders. Most internet
    connections are shared by several people, and many of us use each
    other's connections all the time. Disconnecting one person for
    something that someone else downloaded is flagrantly wrong, and
    without wishing to be melodramatic, collective punishment like this
    is, strictly speaking, in breach of article 33 of the Geneva
    Convention. Plus it makes free wi-fi impossible to provide. Are we
    meant to be <em>destroying</em> the digital economy?</li>
</ul>
<p>If your country doesn't have a Bill like this, rest assured, it soon
will have.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it's clear to me that there's no use in railing against the Bill
unless one has an alternative to offer. The debate in the House of Lords
yesterday made it clear that the mood there is that millions are
flouting the law with illegal downloads to rip off artists and Something
Must Be Done.</p>
<p>So what's the alternative? The solution is the final chapter from
Stanford Law Prof. Lawrence Lessig's book '<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Free-Culture-Nature-Future-Creativity/dp/0143034650">Free
Culture</a>',
that describes how to fix the whole copyright mess in such a way that
will make everybody happy. Artists will get paid in abundance, very
fairly, in a market-driven way, and the payment will be direct to them.
The labels will be eliminated from the loop. No state monitoring of what
people download will be required. Everybody will be able to continue to
download whatever they like from wherever they like, for free (at point
of use), legally and with clear conscience. Best of all, the creation of
new business models and grass-roots creativity such as songs and other
content will be stimulated through the roof. Whichever country first
introduced this would lead the world in a creative tidal wave that
embraces the powers of the internet, rather than fighting against them.</p>
<p>I'm not going to write what the copyright fix is here. I have to go to
work and I'm still in my pajamas. Oh alright, here's the quick quick
version. We add a tax to every high bandwidth internet connection. The
money goes in a pot. Then a central agency samples how many of each
creative work is being downloaded. This is just a sample - it needn't be
tied to any individual downloader, so it is cheap to do and unintrusive.
Then we distribute the money in the pot to artists, in proportion to the
number of downloads they had.</p>
<p>This quick version has some holes in it. Prof. Lessig ties it all up in
his book. Yes it has some problems - taxes are never popular, and more
expensive internet connections are not what we want. But these problems
are small and soluble, compared to what is currently being discussed
instead.</p>
<p>I know this is so starry-eyed idealistic that it has no chance of being
seriously discussed. But I decided last night that I have to at least
give it a try.</p>
<p>Readers from the UK - Do YOU have even the slightest inkling of
interest in suggesting this to your own MP? Or at least pointing out the
downsides of the current Bill? It would just be one evening out of your
life. I'm visiting mine this weekend. Email me if you have any interest
at all. I can lead you through the process, it's simple.</p>

<p>I pretty much abandoned the use of asserts in production code once I was
introduced to test driven development. Amongst their failings, assert
statements are only suited to testing very localised conditions, such as
within a particular function - it's not clear to me how they can be used
to simply verify the behaviour of a number of objects working in concert
with one another.</p>
<p>Some recent papers have touched on this issue. For example '<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=70290">Assessing
the Relationship between Software Assertions and Code
Quality</a>'
by Gunnar Kudrjavets, Nachiappan Nagappan and Thomas Ball of Microsoft:
<em>"We observe from our case study that with an increase in the assertion
density in a file there is a statistically significant decrease in fault
density. Further, the usage of software assertions in these components
found a large percentage of the faults in the bug database."</em></p>
<p>However, both assertion density and low defect rates also correlate with
higher levels of developer experience. So, nothing definitive is proven,
but the study has got me thinking. One of the recurring themes in the
<em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Coders-Work-Reflections-Craft-Programming/dp/1430219483">Coders at
Work</a></em>
book that I enjoyed recently, is that several of the expert
practitioners interviewed in the book mentioned how useful they found
thinking about code in terms of its invariants. The use of assertions
does seem to lend itself to testing invariants like this - some quantity
which can be calculated at the start of a function call, and then
asserted to be unchanged by the end of it.</p>
<p>So can assertions be useful even in code that is well unit-tested? Are
there any rules we can use to choose which things might be more
productively tested using such asserts, rather than in unit tests?</p>
<p>I don't know. This is as far as I've got. Thoughts, speculations and
anecdotes welcome.</p>

<p>See how my cursor is way over on the right. So every command you ever
type gets immediately split over two lines.</p>
<p>This is governed by the PROMPT environment variable. It's the Windows
equivalent of the Unix PS1 variable. You can set this using the
environment variable editing GUI on the System Properties dialog. (I'll
describe a better way to manage environment variables in a later post.)</p>

<p>The dollar codes are expanded into:</p>

They only work within this one environment variable, you can't use them

<p>I had <a href="posts/2009/9/28/python-deployment-sucks.html">a cry</a> last month about
deploying a Python application to end-users being more fiddly and difficult
than I expected it to be. I'm talking about py2exe, Freeze, and their ilk.</p>
<p>As a quick follow-up, I recently <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/browse_thread/thread/5abb44388a28ce25/8ce490b3587719e4?lnk=gst&amp;q=directory+python+installed&amp;pli=1">posted to
comp.lang.python</a>
about a spreadsheet I've made, comparing comparing the solutions I've
found thus far:</p>
<p><a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tZ42hjaRunvkObFq0bKxVdg&amp;output=html">http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tZ42hjaRunvkObFq0bKxVdg&amp;output=html</a></p>
<p>Each column represents a method of distributing a Python application to
an end-user without them having to worry about what Python is or whether
they have an appropriate version of it installed. 'Bundle' represents
manually bundling an interpreter with your application. 'Bootstrap'
represents a sort of fanciful vision of manually creating a compiled
installer which downloads and installs an interpreter if required,
before running your Python application on it. The other columns
represent the various splendid projects like py2exe which perform the
bundling process for you.</p>
<p>Each row represents a reason to choose between them. By my criteria,
which are no doubt idiosyncratic, cx_freeze or maybe PyInstaller are
starting to look like good contenders for future projects.</p>
<p>Obviously feedback about any wrong-headedness on my part is appreciated.</p>

<p>You can switch between different installed versions of Python by simply
prepending to your PATH. However, this goes wrong in some scenarios,
such as when a tool like 'virtualenv' is installed in one Python
version, but not in another. Pretty soon you will be executing your
project with one Python version, but referencing the site-packages of
another. When switching, other versions of Python need to be stripped
from your PATH.</p>
<p>As a solution, I present a new Python module, <em>pychoose</em>. For the moment
this is Windows only:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>&gt;python -V
Python 2.6.4
&gt;easy_install pychoose
...
&gt;pychoose 24
(Py24) &gt;python -V
Python 2.4.4
(Py24) &gt;exit
&gt;python -V
Python 2.6.4
</code></pre>

<p>It prepends to the PATH as above, but it also filters other Python
versions out the PATH. It modifies the PROMPT to show the user they are
operating in a modified environment. It works by spawning a new shell
with the modified environment. To return to your default Python
interpreter, type 'exit'.</p>
<p>PyPI page: <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pychoose">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pychoose</a></p>
<p>Subversion repository:
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/pychoose/">http://code.google.com/p/pychoose</a></p>
<p>Preview the module <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pychoose/source/browse/trunk/pychoose_script.py">source
code</a>.</p>
<p>It seems to work for simple scenarios, but there are a bunch of known
problems with it (see the PyPI page above), which I'd like to fix if
people think this is useful. I just whipped this up and don't really
understand the issues surrounding this. In particular is spawning a new
shell the best way to modify the current console's environment? Is a
less-instrusive alternative to generate .bat file which can be executed
to change the current shell's environment?</p>
<p>Feedback &amp; suggestions very welcome.</p>

<p>A quick response to to polymath Chris DeLeon's thoughtful post
<a href="http://cdgdl.com/lessons/philosophy.html">exhorting the virtues of
Philosophy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A position of ignorance</strong></p>
<p>Right off the bat I should qualify all this by saying that I don't know
anything about Philosophy. I've never studied it. It seems at times to
be an alien mismatch to the sensibilities of my left-brained mind, and
worse, one that claims to be about logic and reasoning, topics that
ostensibly should be right up my alley. I read Bertrand Russel's
<em>History of Western Philosophy</em> last year, and although that was a
fabulous, educational romp through the field, <a href="history-of-western-philisophu">my complaints about
it</a> still stand. Now I'm reading a second
book, <em>Think : A Compelling Introduction to Philosophy</em> by Simon
Blackburn.</p>
<p><strong>The Process</strong></p>
<p>The process of <em>thinking about things</em> is a valuable and worthwhile
endeavour. Some people enjoy it, some people don't. Amongst those who
enjoy it, it becomes an end unto itself, and thought and discussions
typically stray towards the more abstract, the more meta, the more
foundational. Anyone who has gleefully participated in a pub discussion
about religion, death, reality, consciousness, government, or any of a
million other topics has participated in this process. It is joyful,
sometimes enlightening, entertaining, and refines the individual's
ability to meaningfully reason on all kinds of topics, from the abstract
to the prosaic. In this sense, and especially from the perspective of
the individual's active participation in the activity, I'm all in favour
of philosophy. Presumably this is why I have been drawn back to read
this second book.</p>
<p><strong>The Content</strong></p>
<p>If anything, I have had more objections to <em>Think</em> than I had to
Russel's book. At first, I thought that my issue was simply that the
discussed historical philosophers produced curiously shoddy work. Their
premises seem shaky. Their arguments full of holes at best. Their
conclusions entirely suspect. While there are some genuinely insightful
ideas and arguments, they are often mutually contradictory, and the
signal to noise is terrible.</p>
<p>Chris points out the importance of reading a decent translation of the
original sources to gain enough insight to benefit from the arguments,
and in this I defer to his experience. There certainly are some
historical philosophers who seem to make a lot more sense to me than the
others. I had not expected to have to pick and choose based so much upon
my own personal preferences, so in some way my frustration here is
perhaps indicative of an expectation mismatch.</p>
<p>As for <em>Think</em>, as I continue to read, it has slowly dawned on me that
perhaps this impression is actually because the author himself is an
appalling philosopher (sorry Simon!) Every few pages he makes what seems
to me like a terrible logical blunder. If this were correct, that would
presumably make his interpretation of historical philosophers equally
suspect, and perhaps this is why they so often seem simply ludicrous to
me.</p>
<p>I realise it is arrogant and bonkers for me to assume I can outclass the
author, a man apparently of considerable knowledge and experience, at
his own game. But this is how it seems to me, so what am I to make of
that?</p>
<p>It seems to me that there are only three possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Professor Blackburn's thinking is entirely defective. I am sure this
    cannot be the case. He is a professor of his subject, his book,
    while quite understandably not comparable to Russel, has garnered
    great reviews on Amazon and in the press, for whatever that's worth.
    As a layman I shall accord him the deference that is entirely his
    due.</li>
<li>My own thinking is entirely defective. This is, of course, entirely
    possible, however distasteful it may be to me. How would I know? In
    defence of my sanity, I note that I seem to get by, more or less, in
    everyday life. Or at least, I don't seem to be any more confounded
    by the state of the world than the people around me.</li>
<li>Perhaps, then, the problem lies not solely with myself, but is
    shared by us all. Perhaps human reasoning as expressed in the
    English language is generally not sufficiently precise, well-defined
    or powerful to support consistent philosophical arguments of the
    type that are being put forward. More generally, we aren't remotely
    as good at thinking as we think we are. Pretty much I'm saying
    that (1) and (2) are both true, but that both the professor and I
    can derive some comfort from the idea that the same applies to
    pretty much everybody else.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Method</strong></p>
<p>There is, of course, a method for dealing with the unreliability of our
thoughts and perceptions - the scientific method, in its many forms and
manifestations. I have friends who claim that the scientific method came
out of philosophy, and while I have some reservations about the truth of
this in the day-to-day reality of individual practitioners, of course in
an abstract sense I can see that this lineage is real.</p>
<p>Application of the scientific method would be the normal way out of the
morass of imprecise thoughts that, to date, characterise the majority of
philosophy for me. Some aspects of ancient philosophy have proven
tractable in this regard. These are the subjects that have subsequently
calved off from philosophy to form whole new fields and sciences.</p>
<p>Of course, this has the curious effect of diluting the perceived value
of philosophy. As soon as the application of the scientific method lets
thinkers actually gain any traction and start to make real progress on
their topic, we immediately snip that subject off from the realm of
philosophy and give it a different name. Astronomy and cosmology,
biology and psychology, chemistry, physics, and many more. Philosophy
proper, then, consists of the left over bits - the topics upon which the
scientific method has not proven applicable, and hence upon which no
meaningful progress can be made.</p>
<p>Chris, and discussion with friends, has helped me see that in this
dismissal, I was overlooking the value of philosophy as an incubator for
other fields. This is of course critical to the development of human
civilisation, and of interest to historians of the respective fields.</p>
<p><strong>What it isn't</strong></p>
<p>What I'm left with is the impression that my minor experiences of
philosophy would have been much improved if my expectations had been
very different at the outset.</p>
<p>My layman's impression of philosophy from the outside was that it
claimed to be the study of tremendously insightful reasoning done by
some of the most powerful minds in history. This expectation was
naturally bound to lead me to be disappointed when my initial foray led
me to discover that many philosophers, particularly ancient ones,
distorted as they are by translation and interpretation, cultural
mismatch, and lack of my modern knowledge of the world, appear to my
sensibilities to be pretty poor. I hope to improve on this situation by
taking on board Chris' advice about choosing particular philosophers who
resonate for me personally, together with the idea of studying
particular translations of original works, rather than quick summaries.</p>
<p>In addition, I had an expectation that all this intense thought might
lead to some more definitive and objective conclusions. However ancient
philosophers acted without the benefit of the scientific method, and
modern philosophy is pruned of topics to which the scientific method is
applicable. As a result, there is much bad mixed in with the good. Even
the good parts cannot be trusted as a guide to any sorts of truth, since
choosing 'the good parts' seems to be a subjective process.</p>
<p>This seems inevitable, since without the benefit of the scientific
method, there is no utility function to be used as feedback, by which
ideas could be judged and one school of thought meaningfully compared
against another. There can be no definitive winners or losers, and
without competition, ideas cannot improve by evolution. Instead, each
contributor adds their own voice to the mutually contradictory babble,
and it is left to the reader to sift through for the parts of value.</p>
<p>The lack of an objective means to prune the discussion of its less
worthy branches mean that many philosophers are deified, their writings
sacrosanct and studied for generations, even in cases where they were
clearly absolutely wrong. (Plato's thoughts about the shapes of atoms,
for example.) I accept that study of historical and ancient philosophers
is valid for the perspective it gives on the <em>process</em> of philosophy,
and as a study of the <em>history</em> of philosophy itself. However, I am
appalled that so much of their actual, specific writings are studied and
discussed in so much detail, in the same way I would be mortified by the
prospect of scholars spending centuries reviewing the specifics of what
me and my friends said in our philosophical discussions in the pub.
There may be some value in there, but I came to this expecting a prÃ©cis
of the best minds in the world, not a mishmash of sometimes incoherent
ideas.</p>
<p><strong>The Upshot</strong></p>
<p>I've done a lot of bitching, but don't take it as a wholesale rejection.
In addition to the things I complain about, there are also a bunch of
really great, stimulating ideas. I just didn't expect to have to do so
much searching and interpretation to find them. Rather, interpret the
above as the painful transitions in my understanding of what philosophy
<em>is</em>, which parts of it are likely to be of value to me, and what I
should expect from it. Thanks to Chris for his significant contributions
towards my continuing education on this.</p>

<p>Developing software on Microsoft Windows is a bloody awful experience
compared to the boyish flamboyance of Macs or the mad scientist
thrill-a-minute of wrestling Linux into shape. But fear no more, you no
longer need to hide behind that fullscreen IDE, pretending that the rest
of your OS doesn't exist. Help is at hand.</p>
<p>I often feel that with just a dozen small modifications, the UI of
Microsoft Windows could be perfectly usable for me. However, successive
releases of Windows seem to steadfastly ignore the minor changes I'd
love to see. If anything, they move relentlessly in the opposite
direction with every release.</p>
<p>This is the first in a series of tweaks to work around some of these
deficiencies, to create something approaching a sane software
development environment on Windows. If you are a *nix or command-line
jockey, this might make your visits to Windows-land more comfortable. If
you're a Visual Studio devotee, this might add some alternative tools to
your repertoire.</p>
<p>My idea is that each post will be small enough that you can implement
the change it suggests <em>immediately</em>, right now, as you're reading it.</p>
<p><strong>The Console</strong></p>
<p>The console, by which I mean the black DOS 'Command Prompt' window, is
the pivot around which the rest of your software development activities
rotate. Or at least it could be, if it was any good. The built-in
Command Prompt, however, is absolute garbage. Replace it with the
poorly-named 'Console' project from SourceForge:</p>
<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/console/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/console/</a></p>
<p>Once installed, you could fiddle around with the settings endlessly, or
just copy my console.xml config to your home directory:</p>
<p><a href="files/2009/10/console.xml"><img alt="console.xml (config for Console)" src="files/2009/10/xml-icon.png">console.xml</a></p>
<p>after which Console should look something like:</p>
<p><img alt="Console: It doesn't look like much" src="files/2009/10/mswindows-command-prompt.png" title="mswindows-command-prompt"></p>
<p>Console provides a few superficial benefits that prove to be
indispensable in everyday use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut and paste is no longer an unimaginable pain in the ass. What a
    concept. My config automatically copies selected text to the
    clipboard, so you don't even need to hit Ctrl-C. Because of this,
    I've reverted the action of Ctrl-C to its more venerable usage of
    'kill the running command'.</li>
<li>Selecting text with the mouse now works sanely, although sadly you
    can't double/triple click to select words or lines.</li>
<li>Multiple tabs. My config defines keys: Ctrl-T (new), Ctrl-W (close),
    and Ctrl-tab (next).</li>
<li>PageUp and PageDown scroll, without needing to move your hand to the
    mouse. My config actually uses Shift-PageUp and Shift-PageDown, so
    that it's like old XTerms that my fingers apparently still remember.</li>
<li>We can choose any font. I like Deja Vu Sans Monospace, no doubt you
    like something totally different.</li>
<li>We can resize the window however we like.</li>
<li>Transparency. I don't like it, some people do. (<strong>Update:</strong>
    Redacted. I've been converted. Now <a href="http://img177.yfrog.com/i/5cy.jpg/">I love
    it</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The old built-in Command-Prompt will still pop up if you double-click a
.bat file - I don't know how to change this magic built-in association.
Otherwise though, you can now just use the new Console for everything
you do.</p>
<p>Alright. We've taken our first step. Next up, we'll see some of the uses
to which we can put our new toy.</p>

<p>Normally - but not always - people want to run a program just after the
install it - you can help then to do this by using an opt-out system
with a checkbox checked by default</p>
<p>To create the checkbox and control whether it is set you must use the
following properties in your <strong>Product</strong> section:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>Id="WIXUI_EXITDIALOGOPTIONALCHECKBOXTEXT"
Value="Launch the cool program"
Id="WIXUI_EXITDIALOGOPTIONALCHECKBOX"
Value="1"
</code></pre>

<p>The value of <code>WIXUI_EXITDIALOGOPTIONALCHECKBOX</code> controls the
checkboxes checkedness.</p>
<p>You then need a custom action to do some launching:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>Id="LaunchApplication"
BinaryKey="WixCA"
DllEntry="WixShellExec"
Impersonate="yes"
</code></pre>

<p>and some UI wiring in the <strong>UI</strong> element under the <strong>Product</strong> element
to get you custom action called.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>Control="Finish"
Event="DoAction"
Value="LaunchApplication"<span class="ni">&amp;gt;</span>WIXUI\_EXITDIALOGOPTIONALCHECKBOX = 1 and
NOT Installed
</code></pre>

<p>Huzzah - you now may have a working installer.</p>

<p>I don't want to whinge just for the sake of whinging. But I think it's
healthy to assess something I currently find difficult, that I might
better understand where the deficiencies lie and how they might be
addressed.</p>
<p>Deploying a Python program to fellow programmers is easy - just send
them the script, they can install the interpreter if they haven't
already, and figure it out from there. Use of PyPI helps with this.</p>
<p>But distributing Python as source code is only suitable when
distributing to other programmers. For distributing to end-users, it is
totally inappropriate. They have no idea what Python is nor whether it
is installed, and they should never need to know. While it is arguably
possible to lead a user through the process of installing Python so that
they can run your script, it is an absolutely ghastly, terrifying
experience for them, and they will never willingly use your software
again. They want an icon they can double-click on which just runs,
period. Considering the potential complications such as requiring
side-by-side installations of multiple versions of Python, I don't see
this as a workable solution for any serious software to be used by
non-programmers.</p>
<p>Thus we have the projects to convert Python source into stand-alone
executables. I've used <em>py2exe</em> and <em>bbfreeze</em>, and both do a brilliant
jobs at what they do. But there are problems with the use of such tools.</p>
<p>With a compiled language, you can simply give the binary to someone with
the right operating system, and they can double click it to run it.
Better still, this process of compiling and linking the executable for
an end-user is the <em>exact same process</em> that you perform all the time
for yourself while you are developing the software. There is no
additional overhead required to create an executable for end-users
(presuming the simplest case of end-users on the same operating system
that you are developing on.)</p>
<p>With Python this is not true. The whole 'create a distributable binary'
step is an additional headache over and above whatever effort you've
already gone to to make the program run in your own development
environment. Because of this, in a very pragmatic sense, deployment of
Python programs requires a whole extra set of work that deployment of
compiled programs does not.</p>
<p>Presumably this is true for all interpreted languages. I've never worked
seriously with one before. I should go read about how Ruby and more
venerable languages approach and solve these problems.</p>
<p>This situation would not be quite so bad if there was a clear way to
proceed, but for me, my first few binary distributable projects have
been a real ramshackle hack through the docs of py2exe and the various
projects which compete with it. Lots has to be figured out to choose a
tool, and then to get it working with your project. This has to be done
over for each OS you choose to deploy on. For me, it has been a real
time-sink, and I'm still not really happy with the results.</p>
<p>The resulting executables are bulked out by including the interpreter
with each one. This is not a suitable technique for including a bunch of
lightweight command-line executables to augment your shell -something
which, otherwise, you would think Python should be <em>absolutely ideal</em>
for. I guess in some circumstances you could work around this somewhat
by using an svn-style 'one executable, many commands' interface,
although this isn't always suitable.</p>
<p>I'd prefer it if, instead of bundling an interpreter, py2exe looked to
see if a suitable version of Python was already installed, and if not,
downloaded and installed it side-by-side with any existing installations
and then used it to execute your program.</p>
<p>I can't figure out how to tweak the output from py2exe such that my
executable file isn't buried in a menagerie of various other .dll, .zip
and .exe files. An end-user would have no idea what to click on. I want
to make it easy for my users, by creating an executable by itself, with
a subdirectory of binary dependencies (and a different subdirectory of
data.) I could sidestep this by creating an installer that creates a
shortcut to the relevant executable - but again, that would be yet
another day of needless make-work, which has to be undertaken over again
for each OS you plan to deploy on.</p>
<p>For large projects, these sorts of problems are surmountable - they have
enough man hours to soak it up. But for small projects and one-off
scripts, problems like this burn up a substantial proportion of time.
Writing a hundred-line script to solve your friend's particular problem
and emailing him the binary is awkward to say the least. Entries to the
PyWeek 'game in a week' contest are substantially impacted - producing
those binaries burns up hours and hours, when you have precious few to
spare, and very few of the presumably 'average developers' taking part
managed to create binaries that just worked for everyone.</p>
<p>In Python's favour, many of the wrinkles and complications that arise
during the process are due to cross-platform issues. Getting hold of
binary dependencies for other operating systems, stuff like that. The
only reason this seems harder in Python than it is in other languages,
is that when using other languages you often don't even <em>attempt</em> to
deploy across multiple operating systems. The apparent difficulty of
doing this in Python is in actual fact just an illusion caused by being
able to attempt it in the first place.</p>
<p>Doubtless some of my other perceived problems lie in my own
misunderstandings. Nobody else seems to struggle with this as much as I
do. Comments are welcome.</p>
