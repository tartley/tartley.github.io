    <p>I know, I <em>know</em>. But I use Windows for 8 hours a day at work. So what
do you do?</p>
<p>Here's the poster-boy for programmer-friendly fonts, your friend and
mine, everyone loves him, <strong>Inconsolata</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="files/2010/01/inconsolata-11.png"><img alt="inconsolata-11" src="files/2010/01/inconsolata-11.png" title="inconsolata-11"></a></p>
<p>I don't know about you, but to me that looks unutterably crap. Wonky and
irregular. On the right of the orange line is what it looks like with
ClearType turned off. Meh. Presumably I'm doing it wrong, somehow, but
unless I figure out how, Inconsolata can fuck right off.</p>
<p>So then I fire up the trusty fallback, <strong>Consolas</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="files/2010/01/consolas-10.png"><img alt="consolas-10" src="files/2010/01/consolas-10.png" title="consolas-10"></a></p>
<p>This is better, certainly, but the letters look cramped. For the number
of visible lines in a window that size, the letters are awful small.
Again, on the right of the line is ClearType turned off - which in this
case distinctly worse.</p>
<p>So I continue peering at a succession of monospaced idiocy, eventually
ending up on <strong>DejaVu Sans Mono</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="files/2010/01/deja-vu-sans-mono-9.png"><img alt="deja-vu-sans-mono-9" src="files/2010/01/deja-vu-sans-mono-9.png" title="deja-vu-sans-mono-9"></a></p>
<p>This still isn't perfect, but it's the best I can find. Note that it
bears out my impression of Consolas being cramped - even though the
letters are substantially larger, we still manage to fit an extra line
of text in. This time, turning ClearType off (right of the line) makes
it a little crisper, and a little more wonky, but not much.</p>
<p>This isn't just in Vim. It looks like this in all applications. I've
tried running the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ClearTypePowerToy.mspx">ClearType Tuning
Powertool</a>,
to no avail. Admittedly, all these fonts start to look a damn sight
better when I increase the size a few notches. But that's bugger all use
really, isn't it? Maybe I should be digging out some mono fonts designed
especially to be viewed at small sizes? Oooh, now that's actually not a
bad idea: How about those Android fonts everyone's banging on about?
<strong>Droid Sans Mono:</strong></p>
<p><a href="files/2010/01/droid-sans-mono-101.png"><img alt="droid-sans-mono-10" src="files/2010/01/droid-sans-mono-101.png" title="droid-sans-mono-10"></a></p>
<p>This isn't bad, but does contain all the old 'zero vs upper-case O' and
'one versus lower-case L' ambiguities. I think I'll stick with DejaVu
Sans Mono.</p>
<p>Does Inconsolata work OK on Windows for everyone else?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Gerry suggested trying out Proggy Fonts (thanks!). These are
bitmap fonts (unless you want to do without extended characters) so they
won't scale. Nevertheless, here's how some representative fonts from
there look. First up, <strong>Proggy Clean slashed zero:</strong></p>
<p><a href="files/2010/01/proggy-clean-sz.png"><img alt="proggy-clean-sz font" src="files/2010/01/proggy-clean-sz.png" title="proggy-clean-sz"></a></p>
<p>I love the crisp clarity of a pixel-perfect bitmap font with no scaling
or anti-aliasing. On the downside, I have a feeling that the characters'
shapes aren't quite as well-formed and beautiful as <em>DejaVu</em>. Not sure
whether or not this would bug me. Next up, <strong>Proggy Opti:</strong></p>
<p><a href="files/2010/01/proggy-opti.png"><img alt="proggy-opti font" src="files/2010/01/proggy-opti.png" title="proggy-opti"></a></p>
<p>Color me impressed. <em>Opti</em> still has the wonderful pixel-perfect clarity
of <em>Proggy Clean</em>, and manages to fit four extra lines of text into the
same sized window. Obviously in order to achieve this, the characters
are smaller than <em>Deja Vu</em>, but this is no bad thing. I would have liked
to scale Deja Vu down a tad from the size you see it above, but if I
try, the letters start to become a little distorted and indistinct. I
might well give Opti a spin for a few days, see how it wears on me.
Thanks for the suggestion Gerry!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Nowadays I use <a href="https://github.com/ProgrammingFonts/ProgrammingFonts/tree/master/Dina">Dina</a>,
a monospaced bitmap font created by some obsessive with a penchant for
microscopic fonts. It's absolutely perfect.</p>

    <p>A few months ago, <a href="http://millenniumhand.co.uk/">Glenn</a> and
<a href="http://www.babbageclunk.com/">Christian</a> and
<a href="http://freshfoo.com">Menno</a> and myself created <em>Sinister Ducks</em>, a game
with some quacking, for <a href="http://www.pyweek.org/9/">PyWeek 9</a>, a contest
to write a game in Python in a week. It plays a little like a simplified
version of the arcade classic
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joust_%28video_game%29">Joust</a> - press
fire to flap. When birds collide, the highest one wins, while the lowest
one sheds feathers and plummets to the ground.</p>
<p>Since the competition, I've been polishing and refactoring for my own
edification in odd hours here and there, and I'm pleased to declare that
process finished. Behold, Sinister Ducks 1.0.2:</p>
<p><img alt="Sinister Ducks 1.0.2" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tartley/sinister-ducks/master/docs/screenshots/screenshot-final-1.0.2.jpg" title="Sinister Ducks 1.0.2"></p>
<p>Things I added since the competition include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the game being so ridiculously easy that one could play it
    interminably</li>
<li>There are now lives, and an actual Game Over screen and everything</li>
<li>Completely reworked how the gameplay works in regard to attacking
    ducks and collecting feathers - our previous mechanic didn't work
    very well. The feathers now temporarily boost a score multiplier,
    displayed top-left. Attacking other birds yields more points for
    successful chained consecutive attacks, without collecting any
    feathers along the way. But you can only <em>get</em> feathers in the first
    place by attacking birds. It's your job to figure out the resulting
    best-scoring dynamic.</li>
<li>Understand and enjoying the scoring dynamic is aided with little
    floating numbers showing the value of each bird you defeat.</li>
<li>Enemy birds now come in larger waves as time goes on, and one or two
    of the sinister ducks are angry and <em>fast</em>.</li>
<li>The game speed is now scaled by the time between refreshes, so it
    now runs perfectly fine on slow machines or VMs that can't make
    60fps, or if your monitor has an unusual refresh rate, or even if
    you disabled vsync in your graphics drivers to yield hundreds of
    frames per second.</li>
<li>Refactoring and OpenGL performance fixes (those sprites are
    texture-mapped quads, under the covers.) so that it's now massively
    faster than it should ever need to be. The refresh rate with vsync
    disabled on my own 5 year old lappy is about 400fps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Repo at <a href="https://github.com/tartley/sinister-ducks/">https://github.com/tartley/sinister-ducks/</a>.</p>
<p>From there, you can download a Windows 'release' to download, unzip and
double-click, without having to mess about installing Python first. Or a
source release, which will run on Linux or Macs, but you'll have to
download Python yourself, and possibly install the dependencies manually
too, sorry.</p>

    <p>This is a quick post in response to the Vimeo video post <a href="http://vimeo.com/8444889">Getting Rid of
White Halos in Transparent Textures</a> by
FlashBang Studios (creators of the awesome <a href="http://blurst.com/raptor-safari/">Offroad Velociraptor
Safari</a>).</p>
<p>Thanks to FlashBang for the video - the fix you describe, and the
plugins you use to achieve it, are good to know about. If I'm
interpreting the cause of the white haloes you describe correctly, then
your fix applies to more than just Unity development.</p>
<p>Also, you might want to know that there is an alternative solution to
this problem. This alternative solution requires small code changes, and
is possibly slightly trickier to get your head around, but possibly has
a small advantage in that it requires no ongoing effort by the artists
(e.g. applying and undoing plugin actions to color transparent pixels)
once in place. I don't use Unity, so this might not apply in that
environment, but just in case, here goes:</p>
<p>The alternative solution is to save textures using <em>light-opacity RGBA</em>
(a.k.a. <em>pre-multiplied alpha</em>), and then blend them in the engine using
a more appropriate OpenGL blending mode. I learned about this from
<a href="http://http://groups.google.com/group/pyglet-users/tree/browse_frm/thread/7647b57bdec45235/60d2c57881b873e1?rnum=11&amp;q=premultiplied+alpha&amp;_done=%2Fgroup%2Fpyglet-users%2Fbrowse_frm%2Fthread%2F7647b57bdec45235%3Ftvc%3D1%26q%3Dpremultiplied%2Balpha%26#doc_bb176dcbd759ea4c">Brian Fisher's post on the pylget
forums</a>.
I aim to paraphrase his explanation of it here in order to cement my own
understanding of it.</p>
<p>To elaborate, as I understand it, the issue is caused by the bilinear
interpolation between the RGBA of your transparent pixels, and your icon
texture color. For example, for various transparencies of purple on top of 
a blue background:</p>
<p>| <span style="background-color: #0088ff; padding: 1em;"><img alt="" src="files/2010/01/opaque-purple.png" title="opaque-purple"></span> <strong>icon</strong> (1, 0, 1, 1) fully opaque purple
| <span style="background-color: #0088ff; padding: 1em;"><img alt="" src="files/2010/01/halfwhite-purple.png" title="halfwhite-purple"></span> <strong>interpolation</strong> (1, 0.5, 1, 0.5) half-transparent whitish-purple
| <span style="background-color: #0088ff; padding: 1em;"><img alt="" src="files/2010/01/transparent-white.png" title="transparent-white"></span> <strong>background</strong> (1, 1, 1, 0) fully transparent white</p>
<p>(<em>Update: I think some CSS nuance has been lost in a website migration. On
quick glance, this doesn't seem to look like I expect it to, any more.</em>)</p>
<p>The intermediate color isn't actually very close to white, but in
contrast to the pure purple it abuts against, it's significantly paler,
and causes the 'white looking halo' effect around the edge of the purple
icons, as shown in the video.</p>
<p>Note that changing the color of the transparent pixels, from white to
black for example, does not fix the problem - it just changes the color
of the haloes from white to black.</p>
<p>The video shows how to fix this, using a technique that I infer is very
common - change your transparent pixels to be the same color as whatever
colors they abut against. The background pixels are now
fully-transparent purple, giving us:</p>
<p>| <span style="background-color: #0088ff; padding: 1em;"><img alt="" src="files/2010/01/opaque-purple.png" title="opaque-purple"></span> <strong>icon</strong> (1, 0, 1, 1) fully opaque purple
| <span style="background-color: #0088ff; padding: 1em;"><img alt="" src="files/2010/01/halftransparent-purple.png" title="halftransparent-purple"></span> <strong>interpolation</strong> (1, 0, 1, 0.5) half-transparent whitish-purple
| <span style="background-color: #0088ff; padding: 1em;"><img alt="" src="files/2010/01/transparent-white.png" title="transparent-purple"></span> <strong>background</strong> (1, 0, 1, 0) fully transparent purple</p>
<p>So now the interpolation ends up being half-transparent pure purple.
This eliminates the white halo artefact, as demonstrated in the video.
The only minor downside is that the artist has to make sure the
transparent pixels are saved with the correct RGB values, and the plugin
demonstrated in the video helps to automate this.</p>
<p>The alternative solution, is to modify the RGBA values in the texture,
by pre-multiplying the RGB values by the A value. ie:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>R = R * A
G = G * A
B = B * A
</code></pre>

<p>(where all values range from 0.0 to 1.0)</p>
<p>This can either be done in the saved texture file (eg. 3d Studio Max
writes TGA files this way.) Or, if you'd rather continue to use standard
RGBA values in your saved texture files, then your application could do
this transformation when loading image files from disk.</p>
<p>To use these alternate RGBA values in a texture, we have to display them
on screen using a different OpenGL blending mode. We switch from using
the traditional:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="n">dest</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">src</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">alpha</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">dest</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">alpha</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>to using this instead:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="n">dest</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">src</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">dest</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">alpha</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Note how the difference between the two is that the src is no longer
multiplied by the src alpha during blend. This is no longer required,
because we have already done this multiplication in the RGBA of the src
texture itself.</p>
<p>Storing RGBA values in this format is known as <em>light-opacity RGBA,</em> and
it gives us a new interpretation of the meaning of the RGBA values.
Previously, the RGB told us the color of the texture's pixel, but did
not tell us how much this color would be used to affect the destination.
We have to look at the alpha to determine that.</p>
<p>Now, using the new
blending mode, we can interpret the RGB values to literally mean how
much R and G and B is added to the destination. Similarly, the A value
is now only used to diminish whatever existing color is currently at the
destination. It is not used to scale the source RGB before applying it
to the destination. The A value can now be interpreted to mean 'what
proportion of the existing destination color is visible through the
overwritten source color'.</p>
<p>This implies that for pixels to be fully transparent, ie to have no
effect on the destination, they must have an RGB of 0. So we must always
use (0, 0, 0, 0) to represent fully transparent pixels. Note how with
the new interpretation of RGBA, these are not 'black' transparent
pixels, they are literally 'no-color' transparent pixels. This obviously
has a neat logical correposondance to what 'pure transparency' really
means.</p>
<p>The pixels around the edge of the purple icon still get the same
interpolation process, resulting in the same RGBA values as would have
been calculated before, but now we have a different interpretation of
what those values mean:</p>
<p>| <span style="background-color: #0088ff; padding: 1em;"><img alt="" src="files/2010/01/opaque-purple.png" title="opaque-purple"></span> <strong>icon</strong> (1, 0, 1, 1) - pure purple that fully overwrites the previous color
| <span style="background-color: #0088ff; padding: 1em;"><img alt="" src="files/2010/01/halftransparent-purple.png" title="halftransparent-purple"></span> <strong>interpolation</strong> (0.5, 0, 0.5, 0.5) - half-bright purple mixed with 50% of the prev dest color
| <span style="background-color: #0088ff; padding: 1em;"><img alt="" src="files/2010/01/transparent-white.png" title="transparent-white"></span> <strong>background</strong> (0, 0, 0, 0) - fully transparent (no color)</p>
<p>The interpolated color is now blended with the previous destination
color using the new OpenGL blend mode:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="n">dest</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">src</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">dest</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">alpha</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The existing destination color is scaled by (1 - alpha), ie, is reduced
to half intensity, and then the RGB from our interpolated texture (0.5,
0, 0.5) is added to it. This results in a half-transparent purple - even
though the transparent pixels in our texture had no purple at all in
them. This results in a perfect blend between the transparent and pure
purple colors. No haloes are visible.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: It crosses my mind to mention that the halo artefacts will
be visible whenever textures are scaled, rotated, or positioned using
sub-pixel co-ordinates. If you only ever display unrotated textures, at
integer pixel co-ords, and at normal size, then you won't run into this
problem. Since the icons on the radar on FlashBang's video don't seem to
be scaled or rotated, maybe they could sidestep the problem by just
displaying the icons at integer pixel co-ordinates? I don't really know
anything about how their code works though, so I might be talking
nonsense here.</p>

    <p>An open letter I have sent to the ACM.</p>

Ke-Sen Huang, and subsequent conditions imposed over his meticulously
assembled pages of links to SIGGRAPH and other academic computer
graphics papers.
<a href="http://kesen.huang.googlepages.com">http://kesen.huang.googlepages.com</a></p>
<p>The second act is the recent official comment from the ACM on the White
House's public feedback to expanding open access to scientific papers.
This comment is to the effect that the ACM resists the move towards
making scientific papers available to all.
<a href="http://blog.ostp.gov/2009/12/10/policy-forum-on-public-access-to-federally-funded-research-implementation/comment-page-3/#comments">http://blog.ostp.gov/2009/12/10/policy-forum-on-public-access-to-federally-funded-research-implementation/comment-page-3/#comments</a></p>
<p>Both these actions bore the signature of the ACM's Bernard Rous, who has
the unbelievable gall to suggest he opposes the creation of a repository
of academic papers, because it would undermine the ACM's revenue from
keeping such papers behind a paywall, and that this is a legitimate
interest which must be 'balanced with' the interest of the ACM members
desiring access to those papers.</p>
<p>Mr Rous perhaps needs reminding that the ACM's has *no such*
legitimate interest here. The Association's entire existence is soley
contingent upon the benefit that it provides to its members. These
actions seem to me to be in flagrant violation of the ACM's own Code of
Ethics (<a href="http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics">http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics</a>) and worse, it seems to
be contrary to the ACM's entire charter and purpose.</p>
<p>I have no doubt the ACM performs many valuable services which incur
substantial costs, and these costs need to be offset by exploring
methods of generating revenue. But this is not an acceptable method. It
costs nothing to make these papers available online - and the ACM has no
business opposing the establishment of free learning resources that
would compete with its own offerings. On the contrary, the ACM is not a
profit-making organisation. Its charter to promote learning and
education amongst its members, and this can only be best served by
promoting and facilitating the free and open access to academic papers
such as these.</p>
<p>It seems clear to me that if the ACM does not effect an immediate and
total reversal of its policy on these matters, then the Association has
changed from the illustrious body it once was, into a force for ill,
pissing in the well of knowledge, to be actively opposed by
professional, moral software engineers everywhere.</p>
<p>The background to this issue is most clearly expressed here:
<a href="http://www.realtimerendering.com/blog/us-gov-requests-feedback-on-open-access-acm-gets-it-wrong-again/">http://www.realtimerendering.com/blog/us-gov-requests-feedback-on-open-access-acm-gets-it-wrong-again/</a></p>
<p>I would urge others to boycott any further membership payments to the
ACM until this is satisfactorily resolved.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

    <p>So earlier tonight I turned up at the monthly 'surgery' of my MP, Frank
Dobson (Labour), to present my objections to the Digital Economy Bill.</p>
<p>For the benefit of others also going to tackle Mr Dobson on this issue,
(and anyone going to see some other MP) here's a quick write up of my
experiences:</p>
<p>I arrived up half an hour before it started, and there were about eight
parties ahead of me in line. My turn came half an hour after they kicked
off. I had hoped to present my argument pretty much as I laid it out in
my previous blog post. However, sadly I pretty much comprehensively
failed to get my point across.</p>
<p><strong>The 'I am not a spittle-flecked loon' introduction</strong></p>
<p>As planned, I started out by saying that I fully support copyright law,
and of the importance of finding ways to ensure that artists get
renumerated for their work. The portions of the bill which describe the
pursuit of illegal downloaders therefore have laudable and important
goals, however I think that the costs and problems associated with
preventing illegal downloads like this are substantial, and actually
make this section of the bill counter-productive. Mr Dobson was an
affable gent, and listened attentively to what I had to say.</p>
<p><strong>Disconnection needlessly punishes more innocent people than guilty
ones</strong></p>
<p>The first objection I wanted to raise, because it seems to me to be the
most clear-cut, is that the bill suggests disconnection from the
internet for persistent downloaders. I pointed out that since most
internet connections are shared between several people (families and
housemates) disconnecting a single illegal downloader would also
unfairly affect all the people who share their connection. Mr Dobson's
opinion was that it would rarely come to actual disconnection - the
intention of the Bill is very much that disconnection would be a
rarely-used last resort. The earlier provisions in the bill (warning
offenders for their first 'two strikes') are intended to stop almost
everyone from illegally downloading, without any need for actual
disconnections to take place.</p>
<p>Obviously I regard that as a grave misjudgement. But I had a lot of
ground to cover, so I left this issue at that. I still feel that even if
disconnection were only applied to a small number of people (which seems
unlikely, from my perspective), it is still true that this would affect
more innocents than guilty parties. There is no reason not to prefer
more conventional punitive measures over disconnection.</p>
<p><strong>Impossibility of distinguishing guilt from innocence</strong></p>
<p>I moved onto my second point: When monitoring downloads, it is
impossible to distinguish between guilt and innocence. If I download a
song I own, from my home to my office, this behaviour may currently be
legally murky, but it is clearly morally justifiable. To any external
observer, this looks indistinguishable from illegal download. An
observer cannot tell whether a particular download is illegal or not
just by looking at the bits going down the wire - it requires more
context than that. It requires the observer to know which CDs I have
bought, and to what use I intend to put the proceeds (is it subject to
fair use exemptions, etc?) Therefore, along with many illegal
downloaders, the system proposed in the bill will also catch many
innocent people in its net.</p>
<p>These innocents can appeal - there is a procedure in the bill for this -
however they will find it impossible to demonstrate their innocence. If
I have bought a CD and ripped it to my computer (which I have done with
all my CDs, many years ago) then when I am accused of illegally
downloading it, how am I supposed to demonstrate that I once bought that
CD?</p>
<p>Mr Dobson listened with patience and good humour to this. However, it
was clear from his responses that while he is a capable man who is
working hard and with the best of intentions, the scenario I outlined
was fairly foreign to his experience. He suggested that the bill is not
aimed at catching people like me who are doing nothing wrong. It is
aimed at people who are making a dishonest living by massive downloads
which they are somehow making money from. I don't believe that any such
people actually exist, never mind that the bill is aimed at them: The
wording of the bill clearly encompasses individuals downloading music
for their own listening pleasure, and deliberately so, but I did not go
into this.</p>
<p>Mr Dobson felt that the appeals process would be sufficient for anyone
such as my self to protest their innocence. I totally failed to
communicate that demonstrating my innocence during such an appeals
process would be very difficult. When I reiterated that I could not, for
example, produce the receipts to all the music and movies I have ever
bought in my entire lifetime, Mr Dobson reiterated that the bill was not
aimed at innocent people like me, it would only be applied to illegal
downloaders. I again said I don't see how the ISPs can distinguish
between the two - for example I cannot produce the receipts nor the CDs
that my music came from - I ripped them in 1998, and have since
discarded them all. Mr Dobson said that perhaps <em>when</em> the bill become
law (my emphasis), people will be obliged to keep their CDs "in a
plastic bag in the garage", in preparation for just such a scenario. I
pointed out that all of my music for the last few years has been
purchased online - so never came on any CDs to begin with.</p>
<p>Mr Dobson didn't seem receptive to this argument. He was still in good
spirits at this point, however, I totally failed to persuade him that
difficulty in distinguishing between guilty and innocent downloaders was
even a realistic possibility, never mind that it would actually be a
serious problem.</p>
<p>I had hoped to move on from this point to demonstrate that this
presumption of guilt that the bill contains will have a severe chilling
effect on people's legitimate and morally justifiable uses of the
internet, and this will hamper the development of business models, which
will be presumptively quashed before ever getting a chance.</p>
<p>However, Mr Dobson suggested that I should send him the remainder of my
points to him in a letter. I asked him if I could just spend 30 seconds
skipping through the executive summary of the remainder of my argument,
since I felt there was a logical chain of inferences to follow, which
demonstrated some real problems with the bill. He suggested that I write
it to him in a letter instead.</p>
<p>Probable ten or fifteen minutes had elapsed. We exchanged cordial
pleasantries and headed out for a lovely curry down the street with my
awesome wife.</p>

    <p>This is pretty much a riff on what I posted yesterday, only this is my
draft for how I intend to present it to my MP tomorrow. I have no idea
how much time I'll have, nor how receptive he'll be. This may all be a
big waste of time, but just in case, this is my plan, such as it is.</p>
<p>If you think any part of this is idiotic, or that I've misunderstood how
the relevant bits of the Bill work, or that I'm belabouring some points
at the expense of other, more important ones, then I'd really love to
hear about it. The last thing I want is for some stupid part of my
argument to undermine the other parts of it.</p>
<p><strong>The Digital Economy Bill</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldbills/001/10001.i-ii.html">http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldbills/001/10001.i-ii.html</a></p>
<p>I want to clarify at the outset that I absolutely support the importance
of copyright law, its enforcement, and give my full support to the
expectation of artists to be remunerated in a market-driven manner. I do
not want the following arguments to be confused with those which suggest
that copyright should be abolished, or everything online should be
free.</p>
<p><em>(This bit is my attempt to establish some credibility and rapport. In
reality, I think copyright, although sound in principle, is sorely in
need of substantial revision, namely it should be much shorter in
duration, should have larger and more explicit exceptions, and should
require pro-active registering and renewal by the rights holder. But
those concerns are orthogonal to the Digital Economy Bill in its current
form, and raising them here would only confuse the issue.)</em></p>
<p>As a computer programmer, I am directly affected by illegal downloads.
Almost everything I have created professionally has subsequently been
available online for illegal download - affecting my own income and the
financial viability of my employers, such as my current small technology
start-up. <em>(This is not entirely true - some military projects I have
worked on have not suffered any piracy, due to having, shall we say,
extravagant hardware requirements)</em></p>
<p>However, even with that background, I still have strong objections to
the sections of the bill 4 through 17, which attempt to redress the harm
done to the creative industries by the elimination of illegal
downloading.</p>
<p>I believe this pursuit of illegal downloaders comes with problems that
are so profound as to make this portion of the bill counter-productive -
and I believe that a superior alternative course of action does exist,
that would be of substantially more benefit to artists.</p>
<p>The problems as I perceive them are:</p>
<p><strong>1. Disconnection affects many innocents.</strong></p>
<p>Regarding the Obligations to Limit Access described in section 11.</p>
<p>Almost every internet connection is used by more than one person. For
example family members, or independent parties in a shared house.</p>
<p>Disconnection of persistent illegal downloaders will therefore impact
all these other users of the shared connection. The innocent users
disconnected by this legislation will greatly outnumber the illegal
downloaders being targeted!</p>
<p>This similarly also applies to the other, lesser remedies described by
section 11, of affecting service speed or access to particular
materials.</p>
<p>This is flagrantly unfair - a whole household of innocent people are
being punished because of the actions of one guilty person.</p>
<p>Infringing downloads may not even have originated from a resident of the
house. They could easily have been made a dinner guest - very possibly
without the resident's knowledge, and yet they are to be collectively
punished for it. Are hosts expected to prevent this by searching every
guest to their house, demanding guests hand over their phones and other
devices?</p>
<p>This idea is equally problematic when considering publicly available
internet connections, such as at libraries, airports, coffee-shops, etc.
Are they to be disconnected when one of their customers infringes?</p>
<p>My conclusion: Disconnection and the other remedies described in section
11 are not, under any circumstances, appropriate courses of action, even
for the most egregious offenders, and more conventional remedies should
be considered instead.</p>
<p><strong>2. Impossibility of distinguishing guilt from innocence</strong></p>
<p>Several times a week, I routinely download many dozens of online media
from my home collection, to wherever I happen to be at the time - the
office, at a conference, travelling overseas. These are on the whole
media I have previously bought - music or movies or computer programs or
games. I have ripped these legally purchased items to my computer
precisely so that I would have the freedom to move them geographically,
and to format-shift them from one device to another.</p>
<p>To any external observer, these downloads are indistinguishable from an
illegal download. Copying of the exact same songs is involved in each
case. The external observer cannot know that I have already bought the
music or movie or whatever in question.</p>
<p>If I were accused of illegal downloading under this law, which I
apparently would be on a very regular basis, then would have no way of
defending myself against these false accusations. I cannot produce proof
of purchase for all of the media I have purchased over my whole
lifetime.</p>
<p>If it came down to producing the physical media as evidence, such as CDs
my songs came on, then of course many of my songs were purchased online,
and the CDs I bought years ago were discarded as soon as I had ripped
them, in celebration of my freedom from the constraints of physical
media.</p>
<p>Similarly, my accuser, upon whom I believe the onus of proof should lie,
cannot prove the negative (that I never bought the media in question.)
So it is impossible to distinguish the guilty from the innocent, and</p>
<p><strong>3. Chilling effect</strong></p>
<p>The presumption of guilt inherent in the Bill will clearly have a
chilling effect on my personal use of the internet as described above.
The <em>raison d'Ãªtre</em> of the internet is to facilitate the copying of
information from one place to another, and yet my perfectly innocuous
desire to use it for exactly that is, in this instance, prevented for
fear of me being tarred with the same brush as illegal downloaders.</p>
<p>If this were the full extent of the chilling effect that the bill will
have, then it is arguable that this is a regrettable but acceptable
collateral damage in the struggle to recompense artists. However, this
is not the only action that is chilled by the Bill's presumption of
guilt.</p>
<p><em>TODO, this section is weak, and represents what I think is the most
important problem. At the very least, more compelling examples are
needed here</em></p>
<p>Artists exchanging material while collaborating on a project, or or
someone downloading music that they themselves wrote, or business model
that involves copying media from one place to another, all would be
under risk from invoking the penalty of 'illegal downloads', and will be
prevented from occurring.</p>
<p>Personal freedoms and business models of both the present and the future
will be inhibited by the presumption of guilt that the pursuit of
file-sharers requires.</p>
<p>This is, to my mind, the most serious of all the problems with the
Bill's pursuit of illegal downloaders. Instead of stimulating the
digital economy, these measures seem to me to stifle it, by pandering to
the wishes of existing special interests, at the expense of personal
freedoms and the emerging business models of the future.</p>
<p><strong>4. No provision to clarify the legality of innocent use</strong></p>
<p>It is disappointing that the bill does not take the opportunity to make
actions which are both common and morally justifiable clearly and
explicitly legal.</p>
<p>I am thinking here of actions such as my space-shifting of the files I
own, as described above, and of format-shifting between different
devices.</p>
<p>These actions do not in any way represent a valid 'lost sale', and have
absolutely no negative effect on the content industry's business, other
than countering unreasonable attempts to force consumers to purchase the
same media several times over.</p>
<p>Removing the uncertainty about these actions would free individuals from
the lurking threat of frivolous prosecution over harmless activities,
and would foster innovation by giving business some guidelines about
exactly what is allowed.</p>
<p><strong>5. Intrusive state monitoring of everyone's online actions</strong></p>
<p>I strongly object to the notion of the ISPs, acting as representatives
of the State, monitoring every single action that I and my family and my
friends carry out online. It is ripe for abuse, for the information
falling into the wrong hands, and for leaving me under suspicion due to
clerical or other errors during the collection or storage of the data.
It is absolutely unacceptable to me.</p>
<p><strong>6. Lack of substantive evidence that artists income has really
dropped</strong></p>
<p>As stated initially, the goal of ensuring artists are suitably
remunerated for their creations is a laudable one, that I fully support.</p>
<p>Crucially though, the purported losses incurred by the music and movie
industries are commonly derived from flawed studies, directly funded by
the industries in question, and frequently make fundamental mistakes
such as equating every download made with a lost sale. More substantive
information than this is required about the size of the problem.</p>
<p>Indeed, some figures show that the music industry has in fact grown very
healthily in the last few years. For example, these figures compiled and
published by The Times on 12th November 2009, based on the BPI's own
data:</p>
<p><a href="http://labs.timesonline.co.uk/blog/2009/11/12/do-music-artists-do-better-in-a-world-with-illegal-file-sharing/">http://labs.timesonline.co.uk/blog/2009/11/12/do-music-artists-do-better-in-a-world-with-illegal-file-sharing/</a></p>
<p>This suggests that since 2004, recorded music incomes in the UK have
fallen by some £326M. Whether this is due to illegal downloading is not
known - presumably it is partly due to that, and partly due to other
factors, such as the music industry putting out fewer records in recent
years. However, the same figures also show that over the same period,
income from live music and merchandising have risen by the larger amount
of £373M. The industry as a whole is around £47M better off, and as a
bonus, the proportion of this income which is paid directly to artists
has risen dramatically, since artists make more money from live shows
than from recorded music sales.</p>
<p>This fits with my own personal experience - free downloads act as a
tremendous promotional boost for bands. I have many friends who are able
to try out far more music as a result of its availability online, and as
a result are far more active in attending live music events, often of
bands they would not otherwise have heard of, had they not discovered
them online.</p>
<p>If this is true, then free downloads cause artists to lose money via
recorded music, but also to gain more in recompense through other
channels. In this case, do we really need heavy-handed legislation to
protect their interests, if the legislation in question comes with all
the other costs described here? If artists really are earning more than
they were five years ago, do we need to introduce the chilling effects
this bill will cause on the rest of the economy in order to try and help
them out? What if the pursuit of illegal downloaders means that revenues
in live music then drops back to their previous lower levels? Artists
will have actually been financially hurt by this bill. This needs to be
understood before taking such drastic actions as the bill proposes.</p>
<p><strong>7. One alternative</strong></p>
<p>TODO: Lay out the "central pool to remunerate artists in proportion to
their number of downloads" idea, merely to make it clear that there are
alternatives courses of action which could be used to tackle this
situation, which seem to come with real incentives to stimulate the
digital and creative economies, and with smaller, more soluble problems
than Digital Economy Bill in its current form.</p>

    <p>So my splendid talented intelligent handsome friend Robert (who is also
my boss, of sorts) today shared this smashing post:</p>
<p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5417318/my-6247-royalty-statement-how-major-labels-cook-the-books-with-digital-downloads">My \$62.47 Royalty Statement: How Major Labels Cook the Books with
Digital
Downloads</a></p>
<p>About one aspect of how artists get ripped off by the labels. It's not
required reading, but you can if you like. I'll wait.</p>
<p>Hey. So it made me realise that a very possible fix to the dreadful
abuse of artists by the labels is possible. Even better, the solution to
this appalling situation is also the solution to the dire problems with
the UK's Digital Economy Bill.</p>
<p>So the UK govt. are debating a new bill, part of which introduces
measures to ruthlessly pursue illegal downloaders. There are some
problems with this, namely that:</p>
<ul>
<li>someone (probably the ISPs) will have to monitor what everyone
    downloads, and report people downloading anything that trips their
    filters for 'copyrighted work'. Understandably, they don't want to
    do this.</li>
<li>It will cost lots to implement - currently estimated at 100
    million, but of course the ensuing arms race with encrypted
    downloads will inflate that. Has anyone compared this with the
    <em>actual</em> economic losses that it is aiming to fix? (not just the
    inflated ones self-reported by those with most to gain.)</li>
<li>It is literally impossible to automatically detect breach of
    copyright accurately - it can't be done just by looking at the bits.
    There will be lots of false positives and false negatives.</li>
<li>It will be easy to get around, using encryption or similar
    technologies to evade detection. It will not fix the problem it aims
    to fix.</li>
<li>It requires representatives of the state to intrusively monitor
    every single thing we do online.</li>
<li>The false positives will target and punish many innocent people,
    who have no way to demonstrate their innocence.</li>
<li>Perhaps worst of all, its presumption of guilt will have a chilling
    effect on many legal and morally justifiable uses of the internet,
    including business models of the present and the future.</li>
<li>They are talking about disconnection from the internet as a
    potential punitive measure for persistent downloaders. Most internet
    connections are shared by several people, and many of us use each
    other's connections all the time. Disconnecting one person for
    something that someone else downloaded is flagrantly wrong, and
    without wishing to be melodramatic, collective punishment like this
    is, strictly speaking, in breach of article 33 of the Geneva
    Convention. Plus it makes free wi-fi impossible to provide. Are we
    meant to be <em>destroying</em> the digital economy?</li>
</ul>
<p>If your country doesn't have a Bill like this, rest assured, it soon
will have.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it's clear to me that there's no use in railing against the Bill
unless one has an alternative to offer. The debate in the House of Lords
yesterday made it clear that the mood there is that millions are
flouting the law with illegal downloads to rip off artists and Something
Must Be Done.</p>
<p>So what's the alternative? The solution is the final chapter from
Stanford Law Prof. Lawrence Lessig's book '<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Free-Culture-Nature-Future-Creativity/dp/0143034650">Free
Culture</a>',
that describes how to fix the whole copyright mess in such a way that
will make everybody happy. Artists will get paid in abundance, very
fairly, in a market-driven way, and the payment will be direct to them.
The labels will be eliminated from the loop. No state monitoring of what
people download will be required. Everybody will be able to continue to
download whatever they like from wherever they like, for free (at point
of use), legally and with clear conscience. Best of all, the creation of
new business models and grass-roots creativity such as songs and other
content will be stimulated through the roof. Whichever country first
introduced this would lead the world in a creative tidal wave that
embraces the powers of the internet, rather than fighting against them.</p>
<p>I'm not going to write what the copyright fix is here. I have to go to
work and I'm still in my pajamas. Oh alright, here's the quick quick
version. We add a tax to every high bandwidth internet connection. The
money goes in a pot. Then a central agency samples how many of each
creative work is being downloaded. This is just a sample - it needn't be
tied to any individual downloader, so it is cheap to do and unintrusive.
Then we distribute the money in the pot to artists, in proportion to the
number of downloads they had.</p>
<p>This quick version has some holes in it. Prof. Lessig ties it all up in
his book. Yes it has some problems - taxes are never popular, and more
expensive internet connections are not what we want. But these problems
are small and soluble, compared to what is currently being discussed
instead.</p>
<p>I know this is so starry-eyed idealistic that it has no chance of being
seriously discussed. But I decided last night that I have to at least
give it a try.</p>
<p>Readers from the UK - Do YOU have even the slightest inkling of
interest in suggesting this to your own MP? Or at least pointing out the
downsides of the current Bill? It would just be one evening out of your
life. I'm visiting mine this weekend. Email me if you have any interest
at all. I can lead you through the process, it's simple.</p>

    <p>I pretty much abandoned the use of asserts in production code once I was
introduced to test driven development. Amongst their failings, assert
statements are only suited to testing very localised conditions, such as
within a particular function - it's not clear to me how they can be used
to simply verify the behaviour of a number of objects working in concert
with one another.</p>
<p>Some recent papers have touched on this issue. For example '<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=70290">Assessing
the Relationship between Software Assertions and Code
Quality</a>'
by Gunnar Kudrjavets, Nachiappan Nagappan and Thomas Ball of Microsoft:
<em>"We observe from our case study that with an increase in the assertion
density in a file there is a statistically significant decrease in fault
density. Further, the usage of software assertions in these components
found a large percentage of the faults in the bug database."</em></p>
<p>However, both assertion density and low defect rates also correlate with
higher levels of developer experience. So, nothing definitive is proven,
but the study has got me thinking. One of the recurring themes in the
<em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Coders-Work-Reflections-Craft-Programming/dp/1430219483">Coders at
Work</a></em>
book that I enjoyed recently, is that several of the expert
practitioners interviewed in the book mentioned how useful they found
thinking about code in terms of its invariants. The use of assertions
does seem to lend itself to testing invariants like this - some quantity
which can be calculated at the start of a function call, and then
asserted to be unchanged by the end of it.</p>
<p>So can assertions be useful even in code that is well unit-tested? Are
there any rules we can use to choose which things might be more
productively tested using such asserts, rather than in unit tests?</p>
<p>I don't know. This is as far as I've got. Thoughts, speculations and
anecdotes welcome.</p>

    <p>It's a tiny detail, but the default command-line prompt (on both Windows
and Unix) drives me nuts.</p>

<p>See how my cursor is way over on the right. So every command you ever
type gets immediately split over two lines.</p>
<p>This is governed by the PROMPT environment variable. It's the Windows
equivalent of the Unix PS1 variable. You can set this using the
environment variable editing GUI on the System Properties dialog. (I'll
describe a better way to manage environment variables in a later post.)</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>set Prompt=$P$_$G$S
</code></pre>

<p>The dollar codes are expanded into:</p>
<ul>
<li>\$P - present working directory</li>
<li>\$_ - newline</li>
<li>\$G - greater than</li>
<li>\$S - space</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="mswin-command-prompt2" src="files/2009/11/mswin-command-prompt2.png" title="mswin-command-prompt2"></p>
<p>There, isn't that better? There are a bunch of other special dollar
codes, that are described
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/prompt.mspx?mfr=true">here</a>.
They only work within this one environment variable, you can't use them
anywhere else.</p>

    <p>I had <a href="posts/2009/9/28/python-deployment-sucks.html">a cry</a> last month about
deploying a Python application to end-users being more fiddly and difficult
than I expected it to be. I'm talking about py2exe, Freeze, and their ilk.</p>
<p>As a quick follow-up, I recently <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/browse_thread/thread/5abb44388a28ce25/8ce490b3587719e4?lnk=gst&amp;q=directory+python+installed&amp;pli=1">posted to
comp.lang.python</a>
about a spreadsheet I've made, comparing comparing the solutions I've
found thus far:</p>
<p><a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tZ42hjaRunvkObFq0bKxVdg&amp;output=html">http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tZ42hjaRunvkObFq0bKxVdg&amp;output=html</a></p>
<p>Each column represents a method of distributing a Python application to
an end-user without them having to worry about what Python is or whether
they have an appropriate version of it installed. 'Bundle' represents
manually bundling an interpreter with your application. 'Bootstrap'
represents a sort of fanciful vision of manually creating a compiled
installer which downloads and installs an interpreter if required,
before running your Python application on it. The other columns
represent the various splendid projects like py2exe which perform the
bundling process for you.</p>
<p>Each row represents a reason to choose between them. By my criteria,
which are no doubt idiosyncratic, cx_freeze or maybe PyInstaller are
starting to look like good contenders for future projects.</p>
<p>Obviously feedback about any wrong-headedness on my part is appreciated.</p>
